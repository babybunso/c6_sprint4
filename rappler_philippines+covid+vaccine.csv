The Philippine government needs a key measure on indemnification funds to be signed into law
Philippine pandemic officials announced the delivery of the country’s first batch of coronavirus vaccines could be expected by mid-February. But with that timeline looking less likely to be met, the Duterte government’s task force officials announced there would be a slight delay in the arrival of vaccines due to, of all things, paperwork.
Vaccine czar Carlito Galvez Jr and National Task Force COVID-19 Deputy Chief Implementer Vince Dizon pointed to documentary requirements involving an indemnification fund as the culprit behind the delayed schedule.
Why do we need an indemnification fund?
An indemnification fund, Galvez earlier told lawmakers during congressional hearings, was necessary for the Philippines to gain access to vaccine doses from pharmaceutical companies as well as the COVAX global facility.
He requested lawmakers to consider bills that would provide for such in mid-January, adding it could give the Philippines an opportunity to gain access to larger supplies of vaccines and increase public confidence in the government’s rollout.The reason why indemnification funds or programs are required of countries is because vaccines being used worldwide are still under emergency use authorization (EUA), with only limited short-term data available on the full effects that could arise from receiving a shot.Under indemnification programs, governments agree that distributing entities like COVAX, along with vaccine manufacturers, will not be held liable for unexpected adverse events. This is a risk governments absorb during the pandemic when granting vaccines emergency use approval.“You’ll have an indemnification program because there is no full data yet. So if an unexpected adverse event happens, any company cannot be sued because you enter an agreement with the company where you are guaranteeing them that you will take responsibility for any adverse event because you’re aware the data is not complete yet – but you’re allowing its use because there is a national emergency,” said Dr Aileen Espina, a public health and family medicine specialist and member of the Healthcare Professionals Alliance Against COVID-19 (HPAAC).
“That’s why we’re particular that for any vaccine that will be used, the benefits outweigh the risks,” she added.
But vaccines aren't here yet. What else should the government do?
On Monday night, February 15, Galvez said that task force for vaccine procurement officials have done their part in submitting requirements needed to facilitate Filipinos’ access to vaccines. This is on top of efforts by the Department of Health.
Specifically, government lawyers have finished fine-tuning details of an indemnification clause with COVAX and are now waiting on the facility, the World Health Organization (WHO), and Pfizer to finalize it. (Among the vaccines expected to arrive in the Philippines in the first quarter of 2021 are those developed by Pfizer, BioNTech, and AstraZeneca.)
On Wednesday, February 17, Galvez said that the Philippine government has already signed onto the agreements.
The vaccine czar said it was now waiting on Congress and the WHO to ensure the availability of an indemnification fund and concur with the Philippines’ proposed indemnification program, respectively.“Nandoon po sa Congress ang ball at saka po nandoon po sa WHO (The ball is with Congress and the WHO),” Galvez said.
While requirements for vaccines coming from COVAX are steps away from being finalized, lawmakers in Congress will still need to pass measures creating an indemnification program to facilitate access to vaccines purchased through agreements between the Philippines and vaccine manufacturers.
Why are we talking about indemnification only now if it's important?
The government was informed of the indemnification requirement only during the latter phase of vaccine negotiations.
Senator Sonny Angara said on Wednesday, February 17, that this issue was not even raised during the 2021 budget deliberations, ""otherwise, [Congress] would have put a fund on that.""
Galvez first informed the Senate about the need for legislation on the indemnification program during committee of the whole hearings in January. It was only on February 11 that the urgency of this measure was tackled in depth during a public hearing.
Nandoon po sa Congress ang ball at saka po nandoon po sa WHO.
SECRETARY CARLITO GALVEZ JR
Why do we need a law? Won't this further delay vaccine arrival?
A law is needed to be able to tap into the Contingent Fund, as this expense was not covered under the GAA, Budget Secretary Wendel Avisado told Rappler.
National Task Force COVID-19 deputy implementer Vince Dizon said a law is also being required by vaccine manufacturers, aside from the COVAX facility, to hold them free from any liabilities for severe adverse effects arising from immunization.
COVAX officials earlier listed this as part of requirements for all countries participating in the global scheme to ensure equitable access to vaccines, saying vaccine manufacturers were reluctant to guarantee supplies if they were not indemnified against possible liability.“Given the unprecedented speed and scope of deployment of recently licensed vaccines, manufacturers have highlighted the risks of unforeseen claims due to injury associated with the vaccine. Manufacturers are reluctant to deliver COVID-19 vaccines if this risk is not addressed,” COVAX said.For countries like the Philippines that will receive donated vaccines from the facility, COVAX said a model indemnification agreement will already be incorporated in agreements with manufacturers to decrease time spent for negotiations.
Where will the government source indemnity payments?
Since there was no allocation in the P4.5-trillion 2021 budget, the Philippine government and Congress have to look where they could source this.
During a February 11 Senate hearing, two options were considered:
For the indemnity payments to be included under PhilHealth's coverage using its funds
Tapping into the P13-billion Contingent Fund in the national budget, which would require a law
During that hearing, Health Secretary Francisco Duque III said that PhilHealth did not include this in its corporate budget this year, but that the state health insurer will ""study"" the possibility of tapping into its P116-billion reserve funds.
The result of the February 11 hearing is Senate Bill (SB) 2057, which is currently being tackled at the upper chamber's plenary. The bill is proposing the creation of a P500-million indemnification fund to be sourced from the Contingent Fund. This will cover compensation in case of death and medical treatment for vaccine recipients experiencing severe adverse effects.
In the House of Representatives, lawmakers have also filed a counterpart measure through House Bill No. (HB) 8648, which seeks to exempt local government units from bidding requirements under the procurement law, grant tax exemptions for vaccines, and create an indemnification fund for the country’s COVID-19 vaccine program.So far, HB 8648 does not include an immunity clause, nor an amount that will be allocated for the indemnification fund.
Who will implement the indemnification program?
According to Senate Majority Leader Juan Miguel Zubiri, while funds will be administered by PhilHealth, the DOH will be in charge of implementing the indemnification program where adverse events linked to a vaccine may be determined.
This means that if someone were to experience a serious adverse reaction, the DOH, through its post-monitoring of vaccinations, will determine if an adverse effect is indeed linked to the vaccine. If so, PhilHealth would cover the cost of care, with funds sourced from the indemnity fund.

What's the status of pending bills in Congress?
Both Senate and House bills were already sponsored at the plenary. At the upper chamber, interpellations will resume on Monday, February 22, before the Senate version of the indemnification bill is scheduled to be passed on 2nd reading.At the House, amendments to HB 8648 were finalized on Wednesday. It is also up for 2nd reading.
At their current pace, the bills could be passed on final reading during the last week of February or during the first week of March due to the 3-day interval rule between the 2nd and 3rd reading. Since the current versions of the Senate and House bills are different, there's also a chance of a bicameral conference committee (bicam).
If President Rodrigo Duterte certifies the vaccine bill as urgent – as requested by Galvez – Congress can do away with the 3-day interval rule.If the President issues the certification in the last week of February, then there’s a chance that both chambers will also be able to pass the bills on final reading that same week. To further hasten the process, the Senate or the House may need to adopt the other chamber's version, so that a bicam won't be needed. The bill will then be up for signature by the President for it to become law.
Once a law is passed, will we get our vaccine supply immediately?
This will still depend on when the government will sign supply agreements with vaccine firms, as well as the capacity of vaccine manufacturers to deliver doses to all countries that have locked in orders.As it stands, Galvez said only term sheets have been signed with vaccine manufacturers as of mid-February. Term sheets are the second to the last step in vaccine negotiations required to lock in logistics needed for production and delivery.For the last step, a supply agreement will still need to be signed with these companies to facilitate actual purchase and payment, as well as set a definite date for delivery.
Galvez earlier said that current limited global supply has prevented vaccine manufacturers from entering binding supply agreements with the government. – with reports from Mara Cepeda/Rappler.com","{'ANGRY': 0.42, 'ANNOYED': 0.23, 'SAD': 0.11, 'INSPIRED': 0.0, 'HAPPY': 0.0, 'AMUSED': 0.0, 'NEUTRAL': 0.0, 'AFRAID': 0.0}"

(UPDATED) On March 1, the Philippines finally begins to legally roll out COVID-19 vaccines, with the first doses from Sinovac
For nearly a year, President Rodrigo Duterte used speech after speech to claim that salvation from the pandemic would come from one thing only: vaccines. Now, the Philippines is just weeks away from starting an immunization campaign that aims to deliver exactly that.Vaccine czar Carlito Galvez Jr outlined the ambitious targets the government had for its vaccine program: secure at least 148 million vaccine doses and inoculate 50 million to 70 million Filipinos within 2021 – just enough to reach the recommended 60% of the population scientists estimated was needed to reach herd immunity against COVID-19.In reaching these goals, Galvez, along with other pandemic and health officials face challenges that have stumped even the wealthiest of countries when distributing vaccines to the public.With the distribution of the country’s first vaccine doses slated for February, the Duterte government’s timeline for its vaccine plan in 2021 hinges on many things – including delivery, storage, local government plans, and drawing up of masterlists – going right.Where things stand now
On Monday, March 1, the Philippines officially began rolling out COVID-19 vaccine doses.At 9:40 am, the first COVID-19 vaccine in the country was legally administered by nurse Sherlock Cruz to Dr. Gerardo Legaspi, director of the University of the Philippines-Philippine General Hospital (PGH), one of the few coronavirus-designated hospitals in the country.
Along with Legaspi, Food and Drug Administration Director General Eric Domingo, government medical adviser Dr Edsel Salvana, vaccine czar Carlito Galvez Jr, and deputy chief implementer Vince Dizon were also vaccinated.
To secure vaccines, the Philippine government has been in talks with at least 7 companies, including Pfizer, AstraZeneca, Moderna, Novavax, Sinovac, Gamaleya, and Johnson & Johnson (Janssen Pharmaceutica).Galvez said of the 7 companies, there were 5 with whom term sheets have been signed.Term sheets are the second to the last document that needs to be signed. It sees companies commit to supplying doses for Filipinos.Actual delivery and use will depend on details agreed upon in supply deals and whether the vaccine is granted emergency use authorization from the Philippine Food and Drug Administration.As the main person in charge of vaccine negotiations for the Philippines, Galvez said supply deals were scheduled to be signed by the end of February. All contracts for vaccines were expected to be finalized by mid-February, he added.In terms of preparations for the actual deployment of vaccines on the ground, various local government units (LGUs) have been running simulation exercises to rehearse their plans for storing, transporting, and distributing vaccines in their communities.The Department of Health, along with task force officials, approved the vaccines plans of several LGUs in Metro Manila, with more expected to be cleared in the coming weeks.SCREENSHOT FROM NATIONAL TASK FORCE COVID-19
1ST QUARTER: 'Mini rollout'
The first 600,000 doses of Sinovac’s vaccine donated by the Chinese government arrived in the Philippines on February 28.Sinovac was the latest to be granted emergency approval in the Philippines, following Pfizer and AstraZeneca. Sinovac’s vaccine was the first to arrive after delays in paperwork stalled vaccines from the global COVAX Facility, which were initially supposed to arrive in mid-February. This included 117,000 doses of Pfizer and BioNTech’s vaccine and 525,600 doses of AstraZeneca’s vaccine earlier expected to arrive courtesy of the COVAX facility led by the World Health Organization (WHO).
COVID-19 referral hospitals in Metro Manila – the epicenter of the pandemic in the country – will be prioritized for the initial vaccine supplies. The following hospitals were listed:Philippine General Hospital
Lung CenterDr Jose N Rodriguez Memorial Medical Center and Sanitarium (Tala)
Veterans Memorial Medical Center
Philippine National Police General Hospital
Victoriano Luna Medical CenterOther vaccines like AstraZeneca which were expected to arrive in the first quarter will likewise be prioritized for frontline health workers caring for patients in high-risk areas or places where infections rates were still high. (The Philippines expected to receive at least 5 million doses of AstraZeneca’s vaccine from COVAX.)Galvez said this phase of the government’s vaccine plan will be considered a “mini rollout” as it will cover some 1.7 million healthcare workers, along with other government frontliners who will be responsible for mounting the vaccine rollout in the coming months.2nd QUARTER: Vulnerable sectors, 'economic frontliners'
By this time, the government expects 10 to 15 million doses of vaccines to arrive in the country, on top of more vaccines to be supplied by COVAX.WHO Philippines Representative Rabindra Abeyasignhe said the country is potentially looking at receiving a maximum of 9.2 million doses by March or April, while the remainder of the 44 million doses it was entitled to through COVAX will come at the end of the year.The 9.2 million doses will be AstraZeneca’s vaccine manufactured in South Korea, though the actual amount will depend on manufacturing capacity, Abeyasinghe said.Galvez said these vaccines will be used to inoculate members of vulnerable sector such as senior citizens and indigent Filipinos. The government is also eyeing to start the vaccination of “economic frontliners.”During these months, supplies of AstraZeneca’s vaccine ordered by the private sector and local government units are also expected to start arriving in the country.MUST READ

3rd QUARTER: 'Massive rollout' begins
At this point, we should expect the Duterte government’s vaccine rollout to be in full swing as bulk of vaccines purchased should start arriving in the Philippines.The number of doses to be made available in these months was somewhere between 30 million to 50 million, Galvez said. The amount would be enough to start inoculating about 25 million Filipinos.Based on negotiations, some of the vaccines that may be delivered during these months include those developed by US pharmaceutical firms Moderna and Novavax.Galvez earlier signed a term sheet securing at least 30 million doses of Novavax vaccine to be manufactured by the Serum Institute of India, while Philippine Ambassador to the US Jose Manuel “Babe” Romualdez said Moderna was among companies willing to supply doses to the Philippines by mid-2021.4th QUARTER: Targets reached?
In the latter months of the year, what Galvez described as the “full rollout” of vaccines will continue as bulk of vaccines procured through negotiations will be delivered.These months will be crucial if the Duterte government is to reach its goal of inoculating 50 million to 70 million Filipinos. Galvez spelled out the stakes in the campaign, saying the country needed to reach this number if it is to achieve herd immunity and jumpstart economic recovery. – Rappler.com

(3rd UPDATE) The arrival of donated COVID-19 vaccines from China paves the way for the start of the Philippines' inoculation campaign, among the last to start in Southeast Asia
The Philippines' first batch of coronavirus vaccines arrived in the country on Sunday, February 28, paving the way for the start of its mass inoculation campaign with shots developed by China's Sinovac Biotech.
The aircraft carrying the vaccines – a transport plane of the People's Liberation Army of China – landed at Villamor Air Base in Pasay City around 4:10 pm on Sunday.
""There is light at the end of the tunnel. That is light at the end of the tunnel,"" Presidential Spokesperson Harry Roque said in an interview with state-run network PTV. ""At least nagsimula na po tayo. At tuluy-tuloy na po."" (At least we have started. And this will continue.)The delivery of 600,000 doses of Sinovac's CoronaVac – a donation from the Chinese government – was set to be witnessed by President Rodrigo Duterte, Health Secretary Francisco Duque III, and vaccine czar Carlito Galvez Jr at the Villamor Air Base.
Malacañang earlier hailed the delivery of Sinovac's vaccine, which would be used to jump-start the country's vaccination campaign in several hospitals across Metro Manila.
Though the Duterte government had targeted to start distributing vaccines by February, the Philippines is now among the last countries in Southeast Asia to start vaccinating its residents. It was the last to receive vaccine doses in the region.
The arrival of the vaccine comes days after the Philippine Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued emergency use authorization (EUA) for CoronaVac last Monday, February 22.
Sinovac is the latest to be granted emergency approval in the Philippines, though its vaccine is the first to arrive after delays in paperwork stalled vaccines from the global COVAX Facility which were initially supposed to arrive in mid-February.
China first announced it would donate vaccines to Filipinos during the official visit of Chinese State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi to Manila last January.
Senator Bong Go, former presidential aide, said on Sunday that Galvez, Duque, and other Cabinet secretaries will be among the first government officials to be vaccinated with Sinovac on Monday, March 1.
Duterte, 75, will not be receiving Sinovac as the FDA, along with government experts, did not recommend its use for senior citizens or those 60 years old and above. Data from late-stage trials had mostly been gathered from participants 18 to 59 years old.
""To my fellow Filipinos, these vaccines are backed by science and deliberated by our Filipino experts. I encourage that you get vaccinated at the soonest possible time and be a partner in preventing the further spread of the disease,"" Duterte said in a speech.
Health workers go first
Aside from several government officials, health workers were identified as a priority to receive the Sinovac vaccine.
In a press conference later on Sunday, Duterte said health workers who refuse to take Sinovac “have a choice,” and can wait for the other vaccines that are set to arrive in the country.
“Kung ayaw nila ng Sinovac, maghintay sila,” he said. “In a few days, there has been quite a… basta I was assured that [AstraZeneca] would be coming within the next few days.”At least 525,600 doses of vaccines developed by British drugmaker AstraZeneca and the University of Oxford is expected to arrive in a week, after it was postponed from March 1.
In issuing Sinovac an EUA, the FDA said data from Phase 3 trials in Brazil, where a lower efficacy of 50.4% was observed, led experts not to recommend its use for priority groups. The Brazil trials involved health workers exposed to COVID-19.
The recommendation spurred days-long deliberations among experts part of the National Immunization Technical Advisory Group, who later approved the use of the vaccine for health workers, reiterating it is safe and effective.
With vaccine supply scarce and delivery of different brands uncertain, experts said health workers should be given the chance to receive an available vaccine since they are most exposed to COVID-19. In the meantime, health workers who will refuse to get Sinovac were given assurances they would not lose their place in the government's prioritization.The FDA granted emergency approval to Sinovac after separate Phase 3 trials in Indonesia and Turkey demonstrated efficacy of 65.3% to 91.2%. These trials were done mostly in community settings and not among health workers who were exposed to COVID-19.
Aside from the Philippines, Indonesia, Turkey, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Uruguay, and Laos have granted emergency authorization for Sinovac's CoronaVac. – with reports from Rambo Talabong/Rappler.com

(UPDATED) Malacañang says 487,200 doses from the COVAX global facility will be handed over to the government
The Philippines will receive its first shipment of AstraZeneca vaccines on Thursday, March 4, days after logistical concerns and supply problems delayed the delivery of doses originally scheduled for March 1.“This is to confirm that the initial shipment of AstraZeneca vaccines is set to arrive tomorrow,” Presidential Spokesperson Harry Roque said on Tuesday, March 3.
Roque said 487,200 doses of AstraZeneca vaccine would be handed over to the Philippines on Thursday at 7:30 pm. The latest number of doses to arrive is lower than the 525,600 doses the Philippines had expected to receive on March 1.Roque did not say why the number of AstraZeneca doses to be delivered on March 4 was lower.
Roque earlier said that President Rodrigo Duterte is expected to witness the arrival of AstraZeneca vaccines supplied by the COVAX facility led by the World Health Organization.Foreign Secretary Teodoro Locsin Jr thanked countries including Germany, the Republic of Korea, and European Union for donating to the COVAX facility, saying the Philippines was ""deeply grateful"" for their contribution.
Why this matters
The latest batch of vaccines from the COVAX facility will allow at least 243,00 more health workers to get vaccinated against COVID-19. A considerable number had turned down Sinovac's vaccine, opting to wait for AstraZeneca’s vaccine to be delivered to the country.
The Philippines earlier received 600,000 Sinovac doses donated by China on February 28, though enthusiasm for the vaccine was muted amid concerns over its lower efficacy and the robustness of its data compared to other vaccines. (READ: Philippines begins legally rolling out first COVID-19 vaccines)

Health Secretary Francisco Duque III will not be receiving the Sinovac COVID-19 vaccine as the Philippines starts its inoculation campaign, among the last countries to do so in Southeast Asia.
Longtime Duterte aide Senator Bong Go initially announced Duque would be among government officials who will receive the Sinovac vaccine on Monday, March 1. The Department of Health (DOH) later clarified Duque will not be vaccinated with Sinovac as he is over 60 years old.
Duque ""will not be vaccinated with Sinovac as its emergency use authorization (EUA) provisions exclude 60 and above,"" the DOH told reporters on Sunday, February 28.
""He also underscores that we will follow the prioritization framework, and will ensure that limited doses will go to the healthcare workers first,"" it added.

Among new agreements signed included those with Moderna for 20 million doses of its vaccine and Johnson & Johnson (Janssen Pharmaceutica) for 5 million doses of its single-dose coronavirus shot.Galvez’s presentation indicated that term sheets with the American pharmaceutical firms had been signed and that these companies have committed to supply doses to the Philippines.

Both Moderna and Johnson and Johnson will also need to secure emergency use authorization (EUA) from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) before it could be rolled out to the public.So far, the FDA has granted emergency use approval for Pfizer and AstraZeneca’s vaccine, though FDA Director General Eric Domingo said Moderna has expressed interest in applying for an EUA.
Johnson & Johnson is expected to start Phase 3 clinical trials of its vaccine in the Philippines in the coming weeks, after the FDA approved its application to hold late-stage trials in the country.SCREENSHOT FROM RTVM
Why it matters
With term sheets signed with Moderna and Johnson & Johnson, Galvez said the government has secured enough doses needed to vaccinate at least 70 million Filipinos by the end of the year.Aside from the two companies, the Philippines is also eyeing to purchase 25 million doses of Pfizer and BioNTech’s vaccine, while a tripartite agreement is being considered for 10 to 15 million doses of Gamaleya’s Sputnik V COVID-19 vaccine.Prior to this, term sheets had been signed to secure 30 million doses of Novavax’ vaccine, 17 million doses of AstraZeneca’s vaccine, and 25 million doses of Sinovac’s vaccine.On top of this, the Philippines is also expecting up to 44 million doses from the COVAX global facility.MUST READ
TIMELINE: The Philippines’ 2021 COVID-19 vaccine plan
Galvez earlier said the government is targeting to start the rollout of vaccines by February, though the lack of an indemnification program in the country has hindered the delivery of an initial 117,000 Pfizer vaccines from COVAX. Government lawyers have signed an indemnification agreement with the global vaccine facility to facilitate the delivery of vaccines which could be expected in the coming week, he added.Once vaccines arrive, health officials plan to vaccinate some 2 to 3 million people per week to reach its target of inoculating at least 50 to 70 million Filipinos by the end of 2021.The Philippines’ total vaccine orders are pegged at about 178 million, largely in anticipation of delays and other complications in scarce global supply. – Rappler.com

Dr Jonas del Rosario himself contracted COVID-19 and lost his parents to the disease
A doctor and spokesman for the Philippine General Hospital (PGH), the top COVID-19 referral hospital of pandemic epicenter Metro Manila, will be the first person to receive a vaccine through the government's vaccination program.
PGH director Dr Gerardo Legaspi announced this during a Malacañang press briefing on Thursday, February 11.
""We chose our spokesperson, Dr Jonas del Rosario, who since March 22 until today, has been speaking for us everyday,"" said Legaspi in Filipino.
Del Rosario himself contracted COVID-19 and lost both his parents to the respiratory disease.
""Mas maganda para sa mga tao na makita na ang mga taong nagbigay ng kanilang lakas at talino at naapektuhan ng COVID na pinakamatindi ay siya dapat ang mauna,"" said Legaspi to explain why PGH personnel had picked Del Rosario.
Del Rosario will be the first to get the vaccine because PGH has been identified as the hospital that will get the first batch of vaccines. (See the list of priority hospitals here.)
The PGH head said that for hospital doctors and personnel, getting a COVID-19 vaccine shot was a ""symbolic gesture of the final phase of their personal fight against COVID.""
Presidential Spokesman Harry Roque, referring to Del Rosario, said, ""You will be part of history as the first to be legally vaccinated with the anti-COVID-19 vaccine.""
But in the same press conference, Roque announced that the Food and Drug Administration has approved the restricted use by President Rodrigo Duterte’s security personnel of Sinopharm COVID-19 vaccines.
Malacañang has not disclosed details of this deal secured by the Presidential Security Group outside of the government’s official vaccination program. The official program puts military and uniformed personnel on the 5th tier of prioritization, after health frontliners, senior citizens, and persons with comorbidities.
Doctors, hospital workers 'excited' to get vaccinated
PGH doctors and staff are in a state of ""excitement"" over the prospect of getting their first vaccine shot this month, said Legaspi.
At the moment, however, there is no certainty which vaccine they will get. The 117,000 Pfizer vaccines that were supposed to arrive in mid-February will be delayed due to ""processing of documents"" with the COVAX Facility and World Health Organization, said testing czar Vince Dizon in the same press conference.
Despite this ""slight"" delay, the government still expects the Pfizer doses to start arriving within the month of February, said Dizon.
Meanwhile, some 600,000 doses of Sinovac vaccines are confirmed to arrive on February 23. These doses are a donation from the Chinese government, said Presidential Spokesman Harry Roque.
Still, Legaspi said he is confident that PGH doctors would be willing to take any vaccine as long as it had emergency use approval from the Philippines' Food and Drug Administration.
The Pfizer and AstraZeneca vaccines have this approval, but Sinovac so far does not. The Chinese firm applied for an EUA last January 13.
Around 93% of over 5,000 PGH health workers conveyed their wish to be vaccinated, based on a pre-registration survey conducted by the public hospital.
Legaspi said the PGH is ""ready"" for the vaccinations, saying the hospital had finished conducting simulation exercises for the transport and actual vaccination procedure. – Rappler.com","{'HAPPY': 0.33, 'INSPIRED': 0.3, 'NEUTRAL': 0.15, 'AMUSED': 0.0, 'ANNOYED': 0.0, 'SAD': 0.0, 'ANGRY': 0.0, 'AFRAID': 0.0}"

(UPDATED) The Food and Drug Administration's decision clears the way for the use of a vaccine expected to boost the country’s immunization campaign
The Philippines' Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has issued an emergency use authorization (EAU) for AstraZeneca’s COVID-19 vaccine, clearing the way for the local use of the vaccine that is expected to boost the country’s immunization campaign.The COVID-19 vaccine developed by AstraZeneca and the University of Oxford is the second to be given emergency use approval in the Philippines, where health officials are closely monitoring infections after the detection of the more infectious United Kingdom (UK) variant in the country.Its approval comes nearly two weeks after the FDA gave approval to Pfizer and BioNTech’s COVID-19 vaccine which had been the first to apply for emergency authorization in the country.“After a thorough review of the currently available data, the FDA is granting an emergency use authorization to the COVID-19 vaccine of AstraZeneca ” FDA Director General Eric Domingo announced in a virtual press briefing.Domingo said that the vaccine met the Philippines’ conditions for securing an EUA and that the FDA’s assessment concluded that known and potential benefits of the Pfizer vaccine outweighed its known and potential risks.Strategic vaccine
AstraZeneca and Oxford’s vaccine is poised to become a dominant shot in the country’s COVID-19 vaccine program.
The Philippine government, private sector, and several local governments had earlier entered intro tripartite deals with the drug maker to secure up to 17 million doses of the vaccine for Filipinos. (READ: PH vaccine stockpile from AstraZeneca reaches 17 million doses)
Supplies were expected to arrive sometime in the second quarter of the year, though vaccine czar Carlito Galvez Jr earlier said that the government was negotiating for an earlier delivery “at the soonest possible time.”
Unlike other vaccines the Philippines eyed to buy, AstraZeneca was among the few companies that have so far expressed willingness to enter into tripartite deals involving local governments and the private sector. Other companies said to be open to the setup are US drug makers Moderna and Novavax.
Health experts earlier said that AstraZeneca’s vaccine would also be easier to distribute inpoorer and harder-to-reach areas, considering it can be transported and handled at normal refrigerated conditions of 2 to 8 degrees Celsius (36 to 46 degrees Fahrenheit) for at least 6 months, making it compatible with the Department of Health’s (DOH) storage facilities.Early analysis of clinical trial results showed an average efficacy of about 70% after the first dose. The vaccine was seen to be 90% effective in participants who were given a half dose, followed by a full dose. This was compared to 62% efficacy seen in participants who were given two full doses.While the FDA granted AstraZeneca an EUA, it is not yet a full approval.
Securing full marketing authority– which is necessary to commercialize the vaccine and allows its sale in the local market – would be contingent on AstraZeneca’s commitment to finish development of the product. – Rappler.com","{'HAPPY': 0.59, 'NEUTRAL': 0.17, 'INSPIRED': 0.17, 'AMUSED': 0.05, 'ANNOYED': 0.0, 'SAD': 0.0, 'ANGRY': 0.0, 'AFRAID': 0.0}"

PART 1: Rappler sifts through plans of officials involved in addressing the pandemic, particularly how vaccines will be delivered and stored in the country
In February, the Philippines will embark on its biggest mass immunization campaign yet, as it prepares to dole out coronavirus vaccines that could end the health emergency – but not without testing the country’s strained health system and pandemic response once more.To get a picture of the scale of the challenge, consider this: Department of Health (DOH) Undersecretary Myrna Cabotaje said the largest vaccination campaign the government has ever conducted, so far, involved inoculating about 29 million Filipinos. Annual routine immunization programs aim to reach about two million children nationwide.
But targets for a mass vaccination campaign against COVID-19 eclipse these figures, as the campaign aims to cover from 50 million to 70 million Filipinos in 2021 alone. Its desired end stage has a much more ambitious goal: reaching all 110 million Filipinos spread across the archipelago by 2024.For the unprecedented task, the government has partnered with the private sector to facilitate requirements needed for storage, delivery, to actual distribution and tracking of vaccines.In Part 1 of this explainer, Rappler sifts through plans of key officials involved in addressing the pandemic, particularly how vaccines will be delivered and stored in the country. In part 2, we will detail the government's strategy for distributing vaccines from storage facilities to the public.
Which vaccines may arrive first?
In a best case scenario, doses of Pfizer and BioNTech's vaccine may be the first to arrive in the Philippines come February. Vaccine czar Carlito Galvez Jr said this could happen through the Gavi COVAX facility which planned to supply doses to low-income countries for an early rollout.
Pfizer is, so far, the only company that has secured emergency use authorization (EUA) for its COVID-19 vaccine from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) – a requirement necessary for any vaccine to be used on the public.
Aside from the Pfizer vaccine, Galvez said Sinovac and AstraZeneca's vaccines may be next to arrive in the country, considering that doses for the two vaccines were already secured in negotiations.
Both Sinovac and AstraZeneca still need to be cleared by the FDA. FDA Director General Eric Domingo said the agency is waiting for Phase 3 trial data from Sinovac before it can move on to a full review, while AstraZeneca's EUA application is currently under evaluation.

How will vaccines be brought to the Philippines?
Galvez said delivery of vaccine supplies will be the responsibility of vaccine companies and manufacturers, based on current negotiations being finalized.Once vaccines arrive in the Philippines, officials will take up to 15 days to inspect the items, he said. At the House of Representatives and Senate, Galvez also asked lawmakers to pass legislation that would ensure the speedy release of doses from Customs, recalling similar past experiences where personal protective equipment couldn’t get to hospitals that needed them because of Customs requirements.Experts warned the rollout of vaccines could be severely delayed, and the quality of supplies compromised, if necessary measures were not taken to prevent the items from being held up in Customs. Where will vaccines be stored?
Health experts identified two strategies for storing vaccines, depending on their required temperature conditions.The first covers vaccines that need storage temperatures of 2°C to 8°C and -20°C. For these, suppliers will transport doses to the Department of Health’s (DOH) rented private warehouse or the Research Institute of Tropical Medicine (RITM), which is the main storage location of vaccines used for the government’s National Immunization Program.
From here, vaccines will be transported to the DOH’s 17 centers for health development that serve as regional hubs.Citing their experience in storing vaccines for measles, polio, and other routine immunizations, the DOH earlier said there are enough storage facilities in the country for vaccines that need to be kept at 2°C to 8°C and -20°C. These include main sites in Metro Manila, regional centers, as well as provincial capitols.SCREENSHOT FROM DOH
What about vaccines needing ultralow temperature storage?
As for vaccines that will require -70°C or ultracold storage facilities, like those of Pfizer and BioNTech, distributors will transport doses to private warehouses of third party logistics providers tapped by the government.The DOH said final terms of agreements are still being discussed with companies with extensive experience in handling pharmaceutical products, including Zuellig Pharma Group, Royal Cargo, Orca, Maersk, LBC, and Metro Pacific, among others.This comes on top of the 10 ultralow freezers the government procured to store more vaccine doses requiring frigid temperatures, and 5 ultralow units available in RITM, that can store over 1.1 million doses.In an interview with Rappler, Zuellig chief business officer Jannette Jakosalem said the company has ordered 10 ultralow freezers that can each store about 400,000 to 500,000 vaccine doses. Zuellig Pharma – the biggest distributor of pharmaceutical goods in the Philippines – also has plans to purchase 4 more ultralow freezers for use in Cebu City and Davao City.
Partnerships with the logistical companies will be even more crucial in August, when the DOH will need assistance in storing vaccines needing storage temperatures of 2°C to 8°C.Duque earlier said that the DOH expected vaccines for its regular immunization programs to arrive by then, and that it was crucial for these child vaccination programs to continue amid a COVID-19 vaccine rollout.

Until the ceremonial rollout of the country's first vaccines from Sinovac, health workers express reluctance to receive the shot, opting to wait for different vaccines to become available
After nearly 580,000 infections, over 12,300 lives lost, and a year into quarantine restrictions, the Philippines finally launched its vaccine drive against COVID-19 on Monday, March 1.The historic day, long anticipated by millions as the world receded into lockdown, marked a turning point in the Philippines’ fight against the pandemic.
Government officials who witnessed the arrival of 600,000 donated Sinovac vaccines celebrated these as the first “doses of hope” – the moment bringing leaders close to tears, vaccine czar Carlito Galvez said.But for most of the country, the delivery of the first COVID-19 vaccines was met with a mix of anxiety, anger, and a lack of enthusiasm as the public had been made to expect the arrival of Pfizer and AstraZeneca vaccines perceived to be better options.At the Philippine General Hospital, where the President’s pandemic representatives gathered for a ceremonial vaccination on Monday, officials spent considerable time convincing health workers to receive the vaccine.“Huwag nating hintayin 'yung tinatawag na (Let’s not wait for the so-called) best vaccine. There is no such 'best vaccine' because the best vaccine is the one that is safe and efficient, and arrives earlier,” Galvez said.Manila Mayor Isko Moreno echoed the appeal, calling available vaccines an “answered prayer.”“Let me address those who are waiting – I will respect you, your beliefs, and your views but kung ako ay tatanungin ninyo…hinihikayat ko kayo, 'wag ninyo ipagpabukas, 'wag ninyo ipagbakasakali ang kaligtasan ninyo,” he said.(Let me address those who are waiting – I will respect you, your beliefs, and your views, but if you ask me, I’m urging you, don’t put off until tomorrow or leave your safety to chance.)Moreno added: “Remember, if not all of you, most of us, most of you prayed last year to have a vaccine. In God’s mercy, he heard us. I think doctors and scientists here will agree that to develop a vaccine takes so many years but God has so many ways to hear us and I think now it’s up to us to act.”MUST READ

Health workers' hurt
Until the day of the ceremonial rollout, health workers from hospitals taking part in the distribution opposed the injection of Sinovac on them, citing its lower efficacy of 50.4% from Phase 3 trials among health frontliners in Brazil.Hospital workers from the Lung Center of the Philippines (LCP) staged a protest during their lunch break expressing “exasperation” at the Duterte government’s “consistently inconsistent” pronouncements on the mass vaccination program.Health workers criticized the government for passing on the burden of encouraging public trust in vaccination, saying it was the government’s responsibility to provide the best vaccines and be transparent.
The vaccinations on March 1 were the first legal vaccinations in the country, following the inoculation of several officials and government workers with smuggled vaccines in 2020.“Many from our ranks have been infected and some died combating the deadly virus. Our health and lives are always at stake, it is just right and humane that we demand the free, safest, and most efficacious vaccine,” said Eleazar Sobinsky, president of the LCP employees association-Alliance of Health Workers.At PGH, workers also called on the government to deliver the “best” vaccine to health workers. The hospital, among the few COVID-19 designated centers, reported a marked drop in willingness of its employees to get vaccinated days before the start of the rollout.PGH Director Gerardo Legaspi said that over 90% of the hospitals’ workforce had earlier said they were willing to get vaccinated, following the government’s announcement that health workers would receive Pfizer’s vaccine first.
The figure dropped to some 13% after officials said Sinovac would be offered instead, since paperwork on indemnity requirements stalled the delivery of Pfizer doses.Just days before the scheduled rollout, the PGH Physicians Association (PA) decried in a statement the PGH administration for not consulting them, when administrators said the hospital was ready to take “whatever vaccine becomes available.”VACCINATION STARTS.

The physicians urged leaders to wait for the assessment of the country’s Health Technology Assessment Council which reviews the “ethical, legal, social and health system implications” of medical technologies like vaccines, saying this would aid each worker to make a better-informed decision on whether or not to receive Sinovac’s CoronaVac.“The PGH PA stands firm that Sinovac, despite being the only vaccine available at hand should undergo appraisal by the HTAC…. PGH should uphold the ideals of ethical and evidence-based medicine, for which it is a bastion of,” the group said.More reluctance
Meanwhile, at the Veterans Memorial Medical Center, health workers were likewise reluctant to receive the Sinovac vaccine, preferring to wait for other vaccines to arrive.
Food and Drug Administration Director General Eric Domingo, who received the Sinovac vaccine, only appealed to health workers to get themselves vaccinated.The FDA earlier granted Sinovac emergency authorization, but its experts did not recommend it for health workers exposed to COVID-19 since lower efficacy from trials in Brazil had led experts there to not recommend its use in the priority sector. The Brazil trials involved health workers exposed to COVID-19.
Experts belonging to the National Immunization Technical Advisory Group, later approved the use of the vaccine for health workers, emphasizing that it is safe and effective. With doses limited and deliveries uncertain, health workers should be given the option to choose whether or not to get the Sinovac vaccine, they said.
“Consider yourselves and your personal situation and if you are ready, give your informed consent that you are willing to get vaccinated. Just don’t decide to not get vaccinated,” Domingo said in Filipino.MUST READ

Vaccinations a priority
The decision of health workers to receive a vaccine is made more difficult by the uncertainty of when succeeding vaccines will arrive. At least 525,600 AstraZeneca doses were expected on Monday, but this was delayed by about “a week,” owing to limited global supply.Despite government's vaccine campaign and promises that more shots would be available, there is no guarantee when this would happen.Galvez was scheduled to travel to India from March 9 to 12 to sign the Duterte government’s first supply agreements that would pin down a specific date for the delivery of AstraZeneca and Novavax vaccines. Amid the muted response to the Sinovac vaccine, experts who anticipate a surge of new cases in Metro Manila in the coming weeks, said health workers should get vaccinated while the surge is still in its early stages.“Our healthcare workers in the region must seize this opportunity,” Octa Research said.The issue is further compounded by rising vaccine hesitancy, with a recent survey showing some 46% of Filipinos are still unwilling to get vaccinated against COVID-19.
Former health secretary Manuel Dayrit said in an interview with CNN Philippines that his main concern is how fast vaccinations could continue. He pointed out that 500,000 Filipinos would need to be vaccinated daily to achieve government targets.
The more vaccines are delayed, the more impact this could have on health, rising hunger, and unemployment. While the Philippines was among countries hardest hit by the pandemic in Southeast Asia, it was the last in the region to receive COVID-19 vaccines after starting talks with vaccine firms only sometime in November 2020.
Delayed negotiations have narrowed down options for vaccines to be purchased as supplies fluctuate and remain scarce. Until then, Filipinos have no choice but to wait as officials continue to urge people to get themselves vaccinated. – Rappler.com","{'ANGRY': 0.45, 'ANNOYED': 0.15, 'AFRAID': 0.1, 'INSPIRED': 0.0, 'HAPPY': 0.0, 'AMUSED': 0.0, 'NEUTRAL': 0.0, 'SAD': 0.0}"

Vaccine czar Carlito Galvez Jr says the National Immunization Technical Advisory Group is meeting to discuss how the initial 487,200 AstraZeneca doses will be distributed
The first shipment of the AstraZeneca vaccine to the Philippines may be allocated for senior healthcare workers unable to receive Sinovac's CoronaVac, vaccine czar Carlito Galvez Jr said on Thursday, March 4.
Galvez said this strategy is being considered by members of the National Immunization Technical Advisory Group (NITAG), who were meeting to discuss how the initial 487,200 doses will be distributed across the country.""Most likely – may mga doctor kasi na nagsasabi i-priority natin 'yung mga senior healthcare workers…. Our recommendation is for 'yung mga senior healthcare workers,"" Galvez said in an interview with CNN Philippines' Pinky Webb.(Most likely – we have doctors who are saying we should prioritize senior healthcare workers. Our recommendation is for the senior healthcare workers [to get the AstraZeneca vaccine].)
Galvez gave the update as the Philippines is scheduled to receive its first delivery of the AstraZeneca vaccine supplied by the global COVAX Facility on Thursday night. The delivery was supposed to be last Monday, March 1, but was stalled by logistical problems and supply concerns.
The 487,200 doses arriving on Thursday are fewer than the 525,600 doses the Philippines had first expected to receive last Monday.
Galvez said the smaller delivery is due to logistical and packaging constraints as the AstraZeneca vaccine will be delivered to the Philippines through a commercial flight.
Why this matters
Health officials are hoping more health workers will be inclined to take the AstraZeneca vaccine, the only other option to be made available so far aside from Sinovac's vaccine donated by China to the Philippines.
Two days since the Philippines started rolling out Sinovac's vaccine, only some 8,559 health workers have been vaccinated. Enthusiasm for the vaccine was muted amid concerns over its lower efficacy for health workers exposed to COVID-19 and the robustness of its data compared to other vaccines.
But while a considerable number of health workers had turned down Sinovac's vaccine, opting to wait for AstraZeneca's shot, doses are still extremely limited for the priority group.

(UPDATED) Its lower efficacy of 50.4% from trials in Brazil led experts not to recommend its use in the priority sector. The Brazil trials involved health workers exposed to COVID-19.
The Philippine Food and Drug Administration granted an emergency use authorization for Sinovac’s COVID-19 vaccine, after a review of late-stage trial data reaffirmed the shot was safe and effective.
FDA Director General Eric Domingo made the announcement in a virtual press briefing on on Monday, February 22, just a day before Duterte government officials said Sinovac’s vaccines were supposed to arrive in the Philippines.“After a thorough and rigorous review of the currently available published and unpublished data by our regulatory and medical experts, the FDA is granting an emergency use authorization to the COVID-19 vaccine of Sinovac Life Science Company,” Domingo said.Sinovac is now the third company to be granted emergency approval in the Philippines. Its approval follows that of Pfizer and AstraZeneca’s, and may speed up the start of the country’s inoculation campaign set back by delays in paperwork and limited global supply.Health Secretary Francisco Duque III said on Monday that the Chinese embassy in Manila advised Philippine officials it would need 3 to 5 days to prepare for the delivery of vaccines once emergency use for it was issued in the Philippines.Aside from the Philippines, China, Indonesia, Turkey and Brazil have granted emergency authorization for the Chinese vaccine.Not for use among health workers
While the FDA granted Sinovac’s vaccine emergency approval, Domingo said the FDA’s regulatory and medical experts cited conditions and recommendations for its use in the country.Foremost among these was that experts did not recommend its use among health workers, as the group has high exposure to COVID-19.A review of published and unpublished data on the vaccine from ongoing Phase 3 trials showed the vaccine had an efficacy of 65.3% to 91.2% among healthy individuals aged 18 to 59 years old. The findings, coming from community trials in Indonesia and Turkey, means the vaccine is a viable option for this group.But its lower efficacy of 50.4% from trials in Brazil led experts not to recommend its use in the priority sector. The Brazil trials involved health workers exposed to COVID-19.
“The safety profile is good, adverse events were mild to moderate, and possibility of allergy or anaphylaxis is minimal,” Domingo said in Filipino. “When the vaccines arrive in the country, this can be usedin groups where safety and efficacy is proven – 18 to 59 year old clinically healthy individuals.”
Under scrutiny
The emergency approval of Sinovac’s vaccines comes after Philippine lawmakers in the Senate scrutinized the Duterte government’s seeming preference for the Chinese vaccine despite reportedly higher prices and lower efficacy findings compared to other vaccine options.
Before the EUA was issued, health experts held off on judging the vaccine due to limited publicly available data on late-stage trials. Despite this, some of the government’s expert advisers sought to quell concerns over the country’s decision to consider the vaccine, saying its findings on preventing severe COVID-19 infections and death can contribute toward the government's goal of taming the pandemic.
The use of Sinovac in the Philippines is among the few that will be done from the government’s direct purchase of vaccines. Duque said some 600,000 doses may be delivered before the end of the month.
Domingo stressed that while the FDA granted Sinovac an EUA, it is not full approval. Securing full marketing authority – which is necessary to commercialize and sell the vaccine – would be contingent on Sinovac’s commitment to finish development of the product. – Rappler.com","{'ANGRY': 0.36, 'ANNOYED': 0.19, 'AFRAID': 0.15, 'INSPIRED': 0.0, 'HAPPY': 0.0, 'AMUSED': 0.0, 'NEUTRAL': 0.0, 'SAD': 0.0}"

TRACKER: Which COVID-19 vaccines are being eyed by the Philippines?
Janssen, the pharmaceutical firm of Johnson & Johnson, is developing a vaccine using a“non-replicating viral vector” called Adenovirus 26, whichhas been genetically engineered so it can still invade cells but can’t replicate and cause disease. The company used the same method to develop vaccines for Ebola and other diseases.Unlike most other candidates, Janssen’s vaccine utilizes a single dose. Despite this, the company said it would use some Phase 3 trials to study the effects of two doses given 56 days apart.Its vaccine can also be stored in standard refrigerated facilities, making the prospect of distributing and administering vaccines easier for lower income countries like the Philippines. – Rappler.com","{'HAPPY': 0.42, 'INSPIRED': 0.23, 'NEUTRAL': 0.18, 'AMUSED': 0.0, 'ANNOYED': 0.0, 'SAD': 0.0, 'ANGRY': 0.0, 'AFRAID': 0.0}"

The Duterte government starts its vaccination drive as vaccine hesitancy increases, experts warn of an uptick in cases, and vaccine supplies remain uncertain
Over a year since its first reported coronavirus case, the Philippines on Monday, March 1, will finally start rolling out COVID-19 vaccines, offering hope for a country among the hardest hit by the pandemic in Southeast Asia.The start of the Philippines’ vaccination campaign sets off an unprecedented effort to tame the global menace by inoculating at least 50 million people against a disease that has killed over 12,300 and made over 576,000 sick.But long-anticipated vaccinations face multiple uncertainties ahead as vaccine supplies and deliveries to the country remain erratic, and as experts warn of an uptick in cases amid the spread of a variant from the United Kingdom and discovery of a “mutation of concern” in Cebu City.Unknown curveballs
While the Philippines is launching its vaccine drive with 600,000 doses of Sinovac’s CoronaVac – a donation from the Chinese government, Health Secretary Francisco Duque III announced 525,600 AstraZeneca vaccine doses earlier scheduled to arrive on Monday will be delayed for ""about a week,” owing to a “global supply problem.’The delivery of AstraZeneca vaccines was welcome news after an initial batch of 117,000 Pfizer doses expected to arrive in the country in mid-February was stalled due to undone paperwork for an indemnification fund.
Aside from this, the timeline of the delivery of other COVID-19 vaccines eyed by the Duterte government, including those developed by Moderna, the Gamaleya Research Institute, Johnson & Johnson, and Novavax remain unknown as the Philippines has not yet been able to sign supply deals pinning down a date for arrival.This comes as experts just last Saturday, February 27, warned of a “serious increase” in cases in Metro Manila, the epicenter of the country’s pandemic, and recent upticks in cases across several provinces in past weeks.In its latest report, the Octa Research Group on Saturday, February 27, said that the reproduction number (R) – the number of people that one COVID-19 positive case can infect – in the capital region climbed to 1.43 after managing to remain below 1 earlier in the month.""This is similar to the rate of increase observed in Cebu City, Mountain Province, and Benguet, where specimens of the SARS-CoV-2 variant were identified based on genome sequencing,"" it added.The increase in infections and the virus’ reproduction number pose a threat to vaccinations as experts warned rising cases would mean more Filipinos will need to be vaccinated against the disease faster.Vaccine hesitancy rising
Adding to hurdles, the arrival of vaccines comes as vaccine hesitancy increases across the Philippines, with about only 19% of Filipinos saying in a recent survey that they would be willing to get vaccinated against COVID-19.
The figure, released from a survey by the Octa Research Group, is lower than numbers in earlier surveys. Among these were surveys conducted by Pulse Asia which found 32% of Filipinos saying they were willing to get vaccinated if a COVID-19 shot were available in November to December of 2020.A Social Weather Stations survey conducted in September 2020 found 66% of Filipinos were willing to get vaccinated at the time.Health officials are currently targeting to vaccinate at least 50 million to 70 million Filipinos by the end of 2021 – just enough to reach the recommended 60% to 70% of the population that scientists estimated was needed to reach herd immunity against COVID-19. – Rappler.com","{'ANNOYED': 0.24, 'ANGRY': 0.17, 'NEUTRAL': 0.14, 'INSPIRED': 0.0, 'HAPPY': 0.0, 'AMUSED': 0.0, 'SAD': 0.0, 'AFRAID': 0.0}"

Philippine vaccine czar Carlito Galvez Jr said that the government is willing to pay more to secure earlier access to COVID-19 vaccines within the first half of the year.
Galvez made the statement during a televised meeting with President Rodrigo Duterte on Wednesday night, February 24, after setbacks in the delivery of initial doses delayed the start of the country’s inoculation campaign that was eyed to begin by February.""Iyong ongoing negotiation po natin sa mga ibang vaccine ay kailangan po na ina-ano po namin na kung puwede silang magkaroon ng early delivery. At nagne-negotiate din po tayo kahit mapamahal nang kaunti basta ma-early delivery lang po sila ng second quarter at saka po ng first quarter,"" Galvez said.
(In our ongoing negations for vaccines, we’re asking if it's possible to have an early delivery. We’re negotiating to have early delivery in the second and first quarter even if vaccines will be slightly more expensive.)
The retired general said that the Philippines expects to receive about 5.1 million doses in the first quarter of 2021, and about 24.1 million doses in the second quarter.He explained that the ""technique"" they're using is to try to get an earlier delivery of vaccines even at higher prices so that the increase in the prices could be ""offset earlier"" as well.
Galvez and other Philippine pandemic officials earlier targeted to start the country’s mass vaccination campaign by the end of February with doses of AstraZeneca and Pfizer and BioNTech’s vaccine to be supplied under the COVAX global facility. But paperwork and the lack of an indemnification law in the country have stalled the delivery of vaccines to be used on priority sectors including health workers, senior citizens, and vulnerable populations.Aside from vaccines to be supplied by COVAX, the Philippines is in talks to directly purchase shots from Moderna, Novavax, Johnson & Johnson (Janssen Pharmaceutica), US firms Pfizer and BioNTech, British firm AstraZeneca, China’s Sinovac, and Russia’s Gamaleya Research Institute.Galvez said officials are also trying to negotiate with the United Kingdom, China, India, and Russia to increase vaccines expected to be delivered to the Philippines in the first quarter.Under the current timeline of deliveries, the Philippines expects to receive the bulk of vaccines in the third to fourth quarter of 2021 for a “major” rollout.Galvez said the Philippines is supposed to receive 161 million doses by the end of 2021 to vaccinate 50 to 70 million adult Filipinos “in a best case scenario.” This number would be just enough to reach the recommended 60% to 70% of the population to reach herd immunity against COVID-19, based on scientists' estimates. – Rappler.com

Vaccine czar Carlito Galvez Jr says 'more or less' 7 manufacturers will supply the vaccine doses for an initial 50 to 70 million Filipinos
Philippine vaccine czar Carlito Galvez Jr said on Wednesday, January 6, that the government is targeting to secure at least 148 million doses of COVID-19 vaccines for the country in 2021.The supply of 148 million, if fully secured, could cover some 70 million Filipinos, assuming two doses are needed per person. National Task Force deputy chief implementer Vince Dizon said the government wanted to vaccinate 50 to 70 million people within the year.
Galvez said the 148 million-figure was based on current negotiations with “more or less 7” vaccine companies that the government was in advanced talks with, including Novavax, AstraZeneca, Pfizer, Johnson and Johnson (Janssen Pharmaceutica), Sinovac, and Gamaleya.“We hope to close a deal with these companies this month,” he said in a virtual press briefing.What's the timeline?
Galvez did not give specific dates on when vaccine doses from these companies may arrive in the Philippines.He earlier said he expected Sinovac's vaccine to arrive in the Philippines as early as March, but this would depend on whether the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approves the vaccine for emergency use. Sinovac has not yet applied for the necessary emergency use authorization (EUA) with the FDA.(READ: How FDA grants emergency approval for COVID-19 vaccines, meds)
So far, a solid purchase deal was signed with AstraZeneca, the government, and private sector in November 2020. This is for the purchase of some 3 million doses expected to arrive around the second quarter of 2021.Russia’s Gamaleya Research Institute, meanwhile, is applying for Phase 3 clinical trials in the Philippines, while the FDA recently approved clinical trials for Janssen’s vaccine that could start later this month.Galvez also recently told President Rodrigo Duterte that the Serum Institute of India, which partnered with Novavax to produce its vaccine, promised to set aside 30 million doses for the Philippines.
As for Pfizer, no updates have been given after Galvez signed a confidentiality data agreement with the company in November 2020. Pfizer is the only vaccine company that has applied for an EUA with the FDA as of January 6. (READ: Why did the Duterte gov't take months to sign a vaccine deal with Pfizer?)

Why it matters
Launching a mass vaccination campaign against COVID-19 is crucial in taming the pandemic as soon as possible, though the Philippines has been lagging behind in a global race to secure supplies of the coveted good.
A recent study published in the BMJ medical journal found that based on advance purchase commitments, high income countries already reserved over half of doses to be supplied from 13 leading manufacturers.“Even if all 13 of these vaccine manufacturers were to succeed in reaching their maximum production capacity, at least a fifth of the world’s population would not have access to vaccines until 2022,” the study said. – Rappler.com","{'NEUTRAL': 0.24, 'ANNOYED': 0.16, 'AMUSED': 0.15, 'INSPIRED': 0.0, 'HAPPY': 0.0, 'SAD': 0.0, 'ANGRY': 0.0, 'AFRAID': 0.0}"

Vaccine czar Carlito Galvez Jr has cited indemnification requirements as one obstacle that blocked a supposed mid-February delivery of vaccines from the COVAX facility
Philippine vaccine czar Carlito Galvez Jr said on Wednesday, February 17, that the government has signed onto indemnification agreements required for the delivery of vaccines coming from the COVAX global facility.
""On updates for the COVAX facility, we have signed and submitted requirements, including the indemnification agreements for Pfizer and AstraZeneca,"" Galvez said in Filipino during a virtual press briefing.Galvez had earlier cited indemnification requirements as a cause of delay in the arrival of an initial batch of 117,000 doses of Pfizer and BioNTech's vaccine that were expected to arrive in the country by mid-February.The retired general, who was designated to lead the Philippines' vaccine negotiation efforts, said the indemnification agreements from COVAX was only given to officials last week despite earlier requests for details on the issue.
He denied Philippine officials were responsible for delays in the arrival of vaccines in the country, saying they were only on the ""receiving end"" of such requirements from the World Health Organization (WHO) and COVAX.Why this matters
The Philippine government's signing of indemnification agreements with COVAX paves the way for delivery of COVID-19 vaccines needed to start the country's vaccination program.Health and pandemic officials aimed to start the vaccination of frontline health workers in at least 34 hospitals this week, but delays in the delivery of vaccines from COVAX have prevented this.Galvez said that with the agreements signed, the Philippines is now waiting on COVAX and vaccine manufacturers to agree to these so that vaccines may be delivered.COVAX and the WHO have crafted indemnification agreements for countries considered Advanced Marketing Commitment Participants, or those who will be receiving donated vaccines.
This is separate from current efforts of Philippine lawmakers to pass an indemnification fund required for direct purchase of vaccines from manufacturers.Under indemnification programs, governments agree that distributing entities like COVAX, along with vaccine manufacturers, will not be held liable for unexpected adverse events.
It is a standard agreement imposed on all countries who agree to absorb these risks as vaccines developed against COVID-19 are still under emergency use authorization. – Rappler.com","{'ANNOYED': 0.32, 'ANGRY': 0.24, 'AMUSED': 0.21, 'INSPIRED': 0.0, 'HAPPY': 0.0, 'NEUTRAL': 0.0, 'SAD': 0.0, 'AFRAID': 0.0}"

(UPDATED) Here’s what you need to know about the process of approving clinical trials, when a COVID-19 vaccine might be rolled out, and who might receive it first
Over 9 months into the pandemic, scientists around the world continue to develop a viable COVID-19 vaccine as countries fight the spread of the new virus that has infected millions.
Here in the Philippines, a panel of vaccine experts under the Department of Science and Technology (DOST) has been reviewing a roster of potential vaccines with the interest of conducting Phase 3 clinical trials in the country.
MUST READ
Searching for a coronavirus vaccine: What PH clinical trials will look like
Filipino diplomats abroad have also been in talks with vaccine developers and manufacturers to make sure the Philippines has access to an effective vaccine once it becomes available. Among these are vaccines being developed in the US and China.
But these efforts are only half the challenge in ensuring Filipinos are able to receive a COVID-19 vaccine once it is ready for mass use.
While clinical trials and discussions take place with vaccine developers, any potential vaccine will still need to go through regulatory processes in the Philippines before studies here can begin, or the use of vaccines can be allowed.That includes vaccines President Rodrigo Duterte has shown a preference for – like Russia’s Sputnik V COVID-19 vaccine and those being developed by research and pharmaceutical firms in China or the United States’ Moderna.On Wednesday, December 2, Duterte issued an executive order allowing the Food and Drug Administration to grant emergency use authorization for vaccines. This makes granting the necessary FDA approval for vaccines quicker as it can be issued 21 days after a government agency or company asks it to evaluate a particular vaccine.
Here’s what you need to know about how the Philippines will approve trials, how they will be regulated, and when a COVID-19 vaccine might be rolled out to the public.What's a clinical trial?
Clinical trials are a type of research that evaluates potential medical interventions that affect humans’ health. During trials, medicines, treatments, procedures, and devices may be tested to study or verify their clinical or pharmacological effects before they are approved for public use.Trials need to be carefully designed, reviewed, and approved before they can start. Like most clinical trials, tests for a COVID-19 vaccine consist of 3 phases to determine its safety and efficacy.In the Philippines, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is the body tasked with regulating clinical trials.Why regulate trials?
Clinical trials deal with humans as subjects. FDA Director General Eric Domingo said this means that in any study, “the primary concern is always their human rights and safety.”By regulating trials, there is oversight in the way these are crafted, ensuring that trials meet good clinical practice standards and are able to ethically conduct tests involving humans.What might this look like? Domingo said participants should be able to understand fully what trial they are volunteering to join, as well as its benefits and risks. Volunteers should also know what safeguards will be afforded them, like close monitoring, checkups, and health insurance. Participants should also be free to leave the study.In regulating trials, the FDA will also form its own panel of experts to review adverse events that could occur during trials. This will be apart from the clinical trial expert team and safety monitoring committee part of the DOST.
Aside from this, clinical trials are regulated to ensue the integrity of data collected, which will be used to determine whether or not a treatment is ultimately safe and effective. This is especially true in the case of vaccines, which require extreme safety since they are designed to be given to millions of healthy people.
Who can conduct trials?
Only establishments with an FDA-issued license to operate as a clinical trial sponsor or contract research organization can conduct trials in the Philippines. This ensures that the group carrying out the research is legitimate and has the capacity to conduct such studies.In the case of Phase 3 clinical trials for COVID-19 vaccines, interested groups will also need to secure the endorsement of the Philippines’ vaccine expert panel (VEP) and ethics review board.The added step in securing approval from the country’s VEP and ethics board is unique to COVID-19 vaccine trials, Domingo said, because the global search for a vaccine has become much more accelerated due to the pandemic.In this case, the VEP reviews data from Phase 1 and 2 trials of vaccine development companies that intend to conduct Phase 3 trials in the country. Meanwhile, the ethics board ensures that prospective trials will be carried out in such a way that the rights and health of volunteers are protected.What vaccine companies are interested in trials?
For the latest on vaccines that the Philippines is eyeing for purchase or Phase 3 clinical trials, check Rappler’s tracker below:MUST READ
TRACKER: Which COVID-19 vaccines are being eyed by the Philippines?
Domingo said it may take at least 21 days for FDA regulatory reviewers to evaluate and process applications of companies seeking to do trials. This includes 14 days for initial evaluation and a period of 7 days for applicants to respond to any clarifications.After this, the FDA is expected to issue a decision on applications in not more than 8 days after it receives the recommendation of regulatory reviewers.Vaccine experts earlier eyed to have Phase 3 trials start by October, though this has been moved to November 2020.
After trials, what happens next?
Once clinical trials are successfully completed and a vaccine is demonstrated to be safe and effective for humans, companies can apply for a certificate of product registration. The FDA is again in charge of evaluating and approving these.Conducting Phase 3 clinical trials in the Philippines is not a prerequisite for a vaccine to be registered for use in the country.In evaluating a vaccine or any type of medicine, the FDA reviews its scientific data and can also consult with other similar regulatory bodies in other countries to compare findings.Apart from this, the Philippines is also a participant in the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization COVAX facility designed to guarantee rapid, fair, and equitable access to COVID-19 vaccines worldwide.

What is COVAX and why does it matter for getting vaccines to developing nations?
When will a vaccine be available – and who will receive it first?
Vaccine czar Carlito Galvez Jr has said the soonest a vaccine may arrive in the Philippines would be sometime between May to June in 2021 at best, though a more “realistic” timeline was late 2021 to early 2022.While many candidate vaccines are still in their development phase, manufacturers have also begun the work of preparing for production and distribution.
In the Philippines, the Department of Health (DOH) is in the planning phase of how to handle the complex procurement, storage, and distribution of vaccines once they are available.In administering the vaccines to Filipinos, the DOH has experience in carrying out mass vaccination programs through similar campaigns done in the past for vaccine-preventable diseases like measles and polio.Duterte earlier said he wanted the entire Filipino population inoculated with a COVID-19 vaccine “without exception,” adding that his goal was for the government to shoulder the costs for the country’s 113 million population.This remains unlikely for now. In reality, the DOH said it lacked P10 billion of the P12.1 billion needed to vaccinate an initial priority population of 20 million Filipinos.
Finance Secretary Carlos Dominguez earlier said the country aims to source P73.2 billion ($1.5 billion) to pay for the COVID-19 vaccinations of 60 million Filipinos.Funds will be taken from loans from multilateral agencies like the Asian Development Bank and World Bank; domestic sources like LandBank, Development Bank of the Philippines, and government corporations, and bilateral sources from countries where a vaccine is being developed.
As for who may receive the vaccine from the government first, Health Secretary Francisco Duque III gave an overview of groups to be prioritized. These include the following:Health care workers (including those in public and private hospitals, barangay health stations, COVID-19 treatment and rehabilitation centers)
Government frontline workers (including those in the Department of Social Welfare and Development, Department of Education, Bureau of Corrections, Bureau of Fire Protection, Bureau of Jail Management and Penology)

'How can the health workers convince the community to get vaccinated if they themselves are not sold on COVID-19 vaccines?' says Apasrah Mapupuno, the head of Lanao del Sur's health team
According to one rumor circulating in the Philippines, the coronavirus vaccine will allow President Rodrigo Duterte to kill people at the push of a button.
Elsewhere in the country of 108 million, memories of a dengue vaccine that has been banned locally are putting people off the idea of immunization even before the campaign begins.
""Many kids got sick after receiving that vaccine,"" 62-year-old Crisanta Alipio said of the ill-fated vaccine against dengue, a mosquito-borne disease that can be deadly.
She said she was afraid of the novel coronavirus but even more afraid of vaccination.
The Philippines is due to start immunizations next month despite suffering Southeast Asia's second-worst outbreak of the coronavirus with more than half a million infections and over 10,000 deaths.
But officials acknowledge they have an uphill struggle to persuade many people to take it, on top of the logistical difficulties in reaching 2,000 inhabited islands with a precarious health system in the Southeast Asian archipelago.
""Messaging has to be very concrete and evidence-based to encourage people to receive the vaccines,"" health undersecretary Rosario Vergeire told Reuters.
""We are assuring Filipinos that whatever vaccines that will be brought in and provided will go through a stringent process of regulation.""
Dengvaxia scare
Confidence in vaccines was knocked by controversy over French company Sanofi's Dengvaxia.
Rolled out rapidly in 2016 to more than 800,000 children to protect them from dengue – it was banned after its maker said it could worsen the disease in people who had not previously been exposed to the infection.
That led to two congressional enquiries and more than 100 criminal cases that linked child deaths to the anti-dengue shot – though such links have never been proved.
Sanofi has repeatedly said Dengvaxia is safe and effective and the vaccine has been approved for use by the United States and European Union.
After that episode, the Philippines fell from one of the top 10 countries for confidence in vaccines to no higher than 70th place. The number of children who were fully vaccinated fell from 85% in 2010 to 69% in 2019.
To address the fears, health workers would hold town hall and online meetings and be given special training on how to answer questions, said Carlito Galvez, a former army general running the anti-COVID-19 campaign, told the Senate.
The aim is to inoculate 70 million adults this year.

'Big problem'
In parts of the southern Philippines, the big fear is of a state-sponsored death campaign – not completely far-fetched in a country where Duterte's drug war has left nearly 6,000 thousand dead since he took office in 2016.
Remote southern regions are the scene of both communist and Islamist insurgencies.
""Some of the information shared on Facebook and text messages said the COVID-19 vaccine contained a microchip which can be controlled remotely by President Duterte, and once he pushes a button, the person who received the vaccine will die,"" said Nasser Alimoda, a government doctor in Lanao del Sur province.
Everywhere, there is concern over the specific vaccines that the Philippines plans to use too – particularly over Chinese company Sinovac Biotech's vaccine, for which one study showed effectiveness of little over 50%, though another gave it over 91%.
One opinion poll showed fewer than a third of Filipinos were willing to get inoculated against coronavirus.
""Vaccination programs will go to waste if people refuse to get the shots,"" a former health minister, Esperanza Cabral, told Reuters.

Top Duterte government officials and soldiers are among the first to be vaccinated against COVID-19 in the Philippines
Ahead of hundreds of thousands of health workers across the Philippines, some Cabinet officials and soldiers have already been vaccinated against the novel coronavirus, officials confirmed on Monday, December 28.
“I know some from the Cabinet and from the presidential security guards,” Department of the Interior and Local Government (DILG) Secretary Eduardo Año said in an interview with dzMM.
Meanwhile, Philippine Army chief Lieutenant General Cirilto Sobejana confirmed that soldiers have been inoculated in an interview with dwIZ on the same day, adding that he did not know which vaccine provider the immunizations came from.
Keeping it secret
Sobejana declined to name the unit where the soldiers belonged to, but Año identified the Presidential Security Group (PSG) – which is composed of soldiers, cops, coast guards, and civilian personnel – as a beneficiary of the early vaccination.The Armed Forces of the Philippines, in a statement on Monday afternoon, confirmed that the soldiers belonged to the PSG.
As for the Cabinet officials, Año declined to name them, citing their right to privacy. Año appeared to have one Cabinet official in mind when he was asked to reveal their identities.
“I cannot confirm it unless that person will say that he’s confirmed [to have had the vaccine]. Only he can give the confirmation,” Año said.
Was the process followed?
Año and Sobejana said the vaccination was necessary as the Cabinet officials and soldiers were considered frontliners. It is unclear if they followed the government’s own process for vaccine approval.
Under Duterte’s own order, only the Food and Drug Authority can issue emergency use authorizations (EUAs), which could cut the review period of 6 months down to 1 month only.Duterte signed the order on December 2.

(UPDATED) The Food and Drug Administration's decision paves the way for the Pfizer vaccine to be given to Filipinos, but actual delivery remains uncertain as the government has yet to finalize a supply deal with the company
The Philippine Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has issued an emergency use authorization (EAU) for Pfizer and BioNTech’s COVID-19 vaccine, clearing the way for its use in a country hardest hit by the pandemic in Southeast Asia.
The historic approval – a first of its kind in the Philippines – was issued on Thursday, January 14, marking a milestone in the country’s fight against the disease which has so far infected over 492,000 people and killed nearly 10,000.""The FDA today is granting an emergency use authorization to Pfizer and BioNTech’s COVID-19 vaccine. It is decided that all conditions for an EUA are present and that the benefit of using the vaccine outweighs the known and potential risks,” FDA Director General Eric Domingo announced in a virtual press briefing.Domingo said that the vaccine met the Philippines’ conditions for securing an EUA. In particular, evidence from well known and controlled trials showed that “it is reasonable to believe” that the vaccine may be effective to “prevent, diagnose, or treat COVID-19.”
Aside from this, the FDA’s assessment concluded that known and potential benefits of the Pfizer vaccine outweighed its known and potential risks.Why it matters
In a best case scenario, the FDA decision would mean that the Pfizer vaccine can be distributed to Filipinos in a matter of weeks, with health and pandemic officials targeting an initial rollout by the end of February.In reality, the timeline of the vaccine administration and the actual number of doses that will arrive remain uncertain as the government has yet to finalize a supply deal with Pfizer. (READ: Why did the Duterte gov't take months to sign a vaccine deal with Pfizer?)
Vaccine czar Carlito Galvez Jr said the company committed to deliver 25 to 40 million doses to the Philippines if there was excess supply from the United Stares and other countries which had secured orders earlier.
For now, the identified February rollout will greatly depend on whether or not the country is included in the GAVI COVAX facility’s list of states that may get doses of Pfizer’s vaccine for an early rollout pegged for the coming month.Galvez said the government would submit an appeal to COVAX by January 15 to have the Philippines included among countries that will be given a share of doses. Between January 19 to 29, officials from the COVAX facility are also scheduled to inspect ultracold chain storage facilities necessary to keep Pfizer’s vaccine stable, as part of its assessment on whether the country was ready to receive it.Aside from demonstrating 95% efficacy, Pfizer's vaccine offers a boost of hope in taming the pandemic as preliminary studies showed it would likely remain effective against mutations of COVID-19.
The FDA’s decision comes 22 days after Pfizer officials filed an EUA application with the agency. Pfizer was the first to apply for emergency use in the Philippines, followed by British drug maker AstraZeneca.Worth noting
Once the first batch of the Pfizer vaccine arrives in the country, Galvez said it can only be distributed in Metro Manila, Cebu City, and Davao City, as these areas have the facilities to keep the vaccine at a temperature of -70°C (- 94 degrees Fahrenheit).The actual distribution would also be complicated. Health experts have cited the necessary preparation to handle the new vaccine when administering it to patients.
Pfizer officials earlier explained that while doses may last up to 6 months in ultra-low temperature freezers, they can be stored up to 30 days in thermal shippers the company designed, and up to 5 days in normal refrigerated 2-8°C conditions – posing a challenge for the Philippines’ health system.Frontline health workers in areas reporting high incidence of cases are among those prioritized to receive initial doses of the vaccine.
While the FDA granted Pfizer an EUA, it is not full approval. Securing full marketing authority– which is necessary to commercialize the vaccine – would be contingent on Pfizer’s commitment to finish development of the product.More on Pfizer
In November 2020, Pfizer became among the first companies to announce results showing its vaccine was 95% effective.

Vaccine czar Carlito Galvez Jr says that once doses are delivered to the Philippines, some 50,000 health workers in Metro Manila could be vaccinated in February
Philippine vaccine czar Carlito Galvez Jr said on Monday, January 11, the Duterte government could begin distributing COVID-19 vaccines to the public as soon as February 2021.Galvez told Senators that initial doses of a vaccine may arrive in the country by February 20 at the earliest, and that based on this timeline, public inoculation may begin “more or less” in the 3rd to 4th week of the month.Galvez, however, issued a disclaimer that delivery dates were still “indicative” and that actual delivery could happen at least 1 to 2 weeks earlier or later.“Safe to say we will be having that maybe last week of February,” Galvez said, referring to the rollout of vaccines, when pressed by Senator Panfilo Lacson to provide a starting date for vaccination.Galvez said doses expected to arrive in February would “most likely” come from GAVI’s COVAX facility, with the multilateral initiative currently finalizing deals to distribute some 30 billion doses of a vaccine to developing countries for an early rollout.World Health Organization country representative Rabindra Abeyasinghe said negotiations were taking place to finalize a deal that could include Philippines in countries to receive doses for an early rollout, adding Pfizer and BioNTech’s was among vaccines being considered for this set up.
Aside from this, Galvez said China’s Sinovac vaccine may also arrive as early as February, with necessary agreements to be signed later in the week.Who will get the vaccine first?
Health officials earlier said the government would prioritize distributing COVID-19 vaccines to priority groups including frontline health workers in high risk areas such as Metro Manila, Calabarzon, Cebu City, and Davao City.Galvez said officials estimated some 50,000 health workers in Metro Manila could be vaccinated in February once supplies arrive, while some 2 million more could be immunized by April.MUST READ

The Philippines has so far signed deals to purchase at least 30 to 40 million doses of Novavax’ vaccine, while tripartite agreements with local government units and the national government has secured at least 13 million of AstraZeneca’s vaccine for Filipinos.
Aside from this, the country is finalizing deals with Pfizer, Johnson & Johnson (Janssen Pharmaceuticals), Moderna, and Gamaleya. Galvez expressed confidence that the government could lock in deals with these companies to secure at least 100 million doses within the year.If all deals in advanced negations were successful, Galvez said the country could purchase some 148 million doses in 2021 to vaccinate some 50 to 70 million Filipinos. – Rappler.com","{'HAPPY': 0.28, 'NEUTRAL': 0.19, 'INSPIRED': 0.13, 'AMUSED': 0.0, 'ANNOYED': 0.0, 'SAD': 0.0, 'ANGRY': 0.0, 'AFRAID': 0.0}"

Only 19% of Filipinos say they are willing to have themselves vaccinated
While the Philippines awaits the arrival of coronavirus vaccines necessary to tame the pandemic, a survey of the Octa Research Group showed a great number of Filipinos are still unwilling to have themselves vaccinated against the disease.The survey, conducted from January 26 to February 1, 2021, showed that if a safe and effective vaccine were available during the polling period, the greatest number of respondents at 46% said, “I will not have myself vaccinated.”The survey released on Wednesday night, February 24, also found that only 19% of respondents said they would have themselves vaccinated, while 35% said ""can't say"" if they will have themselves vaccinated.The Octa team based findings on face-to-face interviews with 1,200 Filipinos aged 18 years old and above. It has a 95% confidence level with a ±3% margin of error.Safety top concern
Among those unwilling to get vaccinated, the survey found the respondents' top 3 reasons for refusing a vaccine were the following:“Not sure if it is safe” (73%)
“Not sure if vaccine is effective” (29%)
“A vaccine is not needed to combat COVID-19” (9%)Concern about the safety of a vaccine was higher in Mindanao (78%) and Balance Luzon (76%) compared to Metro Manila (69%) and the Visayas (64%). Along with this, concern about vaccine effectiveness was highest in the Visayas (46%), followed by Metro Manila (34%), Mindanao (27%), and Balance Luzon (21%).
Aside from this, 6% of survey respondents said they would not have themselves vaccinated as the vaccine “might not be free,” while another 6% said they would not get vaccinated because it “might be costly or expensive.”The survey found class D (74%) and E (73%) were more concerned with the safety of vaccines compared to class ABC (46%). It was the reverse for concern over efficacy of vaccines with class ABC (33%) reporting the highest concern about this as compared to class D (28%) and E (29%).For respondents who would reject a vaccine, disapproval was highest among class D, with 46% of the respondents saying they would not have themselves vaccinated. This was followed by class ABC at 45% and class E at 44%.Balance Luzon and the Visayas also recorded the highest percentage of those unwilling to get a vaccine at 47% each, followed by Metro Manila and Mindanao at 43% each.Vaccine acceptance was highest among class ABC and E (23% each), while class D was slightly lower at (18%).
Of the 35% of respondents undecided about the vaccine, uncertainty was highest in Balance Luzon (39%), while Metro Manila, the Visayas, and Mindanao were “almost at par” at 31%, 33%, and 32%, respectively. Among those undecided, 32% were from class ABC, 36% from class D, and 33% from class E.
Low trust in China vaccines
The Octa survey found only 1 in 10 or 15% Filipinos trusted vaccines coming from China, while 4 in 10 (41%) trusted those coming from the United States.In between these, 25% said they trusted vaccines coming from the United Kingdom, followed by 20% from Russia, and 17% if coming from India.The 5 countries cover a portfolio of at least 7 vaccine companies the Philippines has been in advanced negotiations with to purchase vaccines. This included Pfizer and BioNTech, Moderna, Novavax, Johnson & Johnson (Janssen Pharmaceutica), AstraZeneca, Sinovac, and the Gamaleya Research Institute.Why this matters
The number of respondents both unwilling and reluctant to receive a vaccine underscores the challenges health officials still need to confront in boosting demand for the highly scarce and coveted product.This comes on top of issues in vaccine acceptance in the Philippines, which took a hit after the Dengvaxia scandal in 2017 tanked immunization rates of public vaccination programs largely done among the indigent sector.The Philippines so far has been the last in the Southeast Asia region to start rolling out vaccines, after paperwork and limited global supply delayed the delivery of doses secured in negotiations that started only sometime in November 2020. – Rappler.com","{'NEUTRAL': 0.25, 'SAD': 0.2, 'ANNOYED': 0.16, 'AMUSED': 0.16, 'INSPIRED': 0.0, 'HAPPY': 0.0, 'ANGRY': 0.0, 'AFRAID': 0.0}"

Galvez earlier said health officials want frontline health and government workers, senior citizens, indigent Filipinos, and uniformed personnel to be the first to receive COVID-19 vaccines.But no less than President Rodrigo Duterte himself revealed in December that certain members of his Cabinet and close-in security have already been immunized – and with unregistered COVID-19 vaccines at that, a clear violation of the national government’s own laws and protocols.
Government officials have so far failed to properly explain how the unregulated immunization efforts took place. – with reports from Mara Cepeda, Ryan Macasero, Pia Ranada, Bonz Magsambol, and Rambo Talabong/Rappler.com

President Rodrigo Duterte defends Chinese-made vaccines, claiming they are every bit as reliable as Western ones
The Philippines has signed an agreement for 25 million doses of CoronaVac, the coronavirus vaccine of Chinese firm Sinovac.
Vaccine czar Carlito Galvez Jr confirmed this in a meeting with President Rodrigo Duterte on Wednesday, January 13.
""They gave a commitment, and I signed the term sheet and had a copy of the signed term sheet for 25 million [doses] sent to Hong Kong,"" he said in Filipino.
An initial batch of 50,000 doses is expected to arrive in the country on February 20, to be followed by 950,000 more doses in March.
Galvez praised Sinovac for being the ""only"" vaccine maker to give definite monthly delivery dates for its doses.
Why this matters
The signing of the term sheet adds to the Philippines' list of agreements, locking in millions of the sought-after jabs for Filipinos.
Previously signed were deals for 30 million doses of the vaccine of US firm Novavax and 15 million doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine through tripartite agreements with local governments and private corporations.
However, the Food and Drug Administration is yet to approve any vaccine for emergency use. Of the 3 vaccines secured through signed deals, only AstraZeneca has applied for emergency use approval as of writing.

Duterte defends Chinese vaccines
In the same meeting, Duterte defended Chinese-made vaccines, claiming they are every bit as reliable as Western ones.
""It's as good as any other bakuna na na-imbento ng mga Amerikano or mga Europeans. Hindi nag-kulang ang Chinese, hindi sila nagkulang sa utak,"" said the Philippine leader.
(It's as good as vaccines invented by the Americans or Europeans. These Chinese don't lack in brains.)
""Kung kayong walang pera at gusto ninyo ng bakuna na mas maganda, mas mabisa, wala, tabla lahat ‘yan. Pareho lang ang pinag-aralan nila,"" Duterte also said.
(If you don't have money and you want a vaccine that is better, more effective, that's nothing, all of them are equal. They all have the same expertise.)
The Sinovac vaccine, however, has raised eyebrows for producing very different efficacy rates across various clinical trial sites.
In Brazil, where Sinovac's biggest clinical trial is being conducted, the vaccine was initially said to be 78% effective in preventing mild cases of COVID-19 and 100% effective in preventing severe infections. But new data showed that the overall efficacy rate is 50.38%.
Sinovac has also published less clinical trial data compared to Western vaccine makers. – Rappler.com","{'ANGRY': 0.43, 'ANNOYED': 0.22, 'SAD': 0.09, 'INSPIRED': 0.0, 'HAPPY': 0.0, 'AMUSED': 0.0, 'NEUTRAL': 0.0, 'AFRAID': 0.0}"

(UPDATED) These vaccines will be the Philippines' very first batch of COVID-19 jabs
The first batch of Sinovac vaccines is scheduled to arrive in the Philippines on Sunday, February 28, announced Malacañang.
""We expect that the delivery will arrive on Sunday,"" Presidential Spokesperson Harry Roque said in Filipino on Thursday, February 25.
These vaccines will be the Philippines' very first batch of COVID-19 jabs. The country lags behind some of its Southeast Asian neighbors like Indonesia and Malaysia, who have kickstarted their vaccination drives.
Government officials will be physically welcoming the arrival of the much-awaited vaccines, added Roque.
A Sinovac executive, general manager Helen Yang, previously said that the first delivery involves 600,000 doses, all of which are donated. They will arrive all together in a military plane. Of this, 100,000 have been reserved for the military.
President Rodrigo Duterte had wanted to be present in the welcoming ceremony for the vaccines but his attendance is not yet confirmed.
In a statement posted on Facebook, Chinese Ambassador to the Philippines Huang Xilian said the delivery of the Philippines' first COVID-19 doses is a testament to the “profound friendship and partnership” between Manila and Beijing.
“It is a fine tradition between China and the Philippines to help each other in trying times. A friend in need is a friend indeed.... I hope the vaccines will help kick off Philippines’ mass inoculation campaign to curb the pandemic and allow Filipinos’ life to return to normal at the earliest,” Huang said.
Vaccine czar Carlito Galvez Jr had previously said it would take ""2 to 3 days"" after the arrival of vaccines for the government to administer the first doses to priority Filipinos.
CoronaVac, Sinovac's vaccine, was approved for emergency use just last Monday, February 22, but government experts do not recommend its use for health workers, which had been identified as the first priority of the vaccination program.
But government experts are still in deliberations to finalize the guidelines for CoronaVac. Malacañang has said health workers can still get the Sinovac vaccine if they wanted because the Food and Drug Administration only recommends against it but does not prohibit such use.
Indonesia, Brazil, and Turkey have used CoronaVac for their health workers. – with a report from Sofia Tomacruz/Rappler.com","{'AMUSED': 0.21, 'ANNOYED': 0.19, 'HAPPY': 0.16, 'NEUTRAL': 0.16, 'INSPIRED': 0.0, 'SAD': 0.0, 'ANGRY': 0.0, 'AFRAID': 0.0}"

The President again declares his vote of confidence for China and Russia vaccines, saying he prefers them to US vaccines
Stepping up his populist messaging during the pandemic, Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte said his goal is for his government to shoulder COVID-19 vaccination for each Filipino.
He declared this during a ""message to the people"" aired late Wednesday, October 14, after his meeting with coronavirus task force officials.
""I have the money already for the vaccine. But hahanap pa ako ng maraming pera (I will look for more money) because, you know, there are now 113 million Filipinos and to me, ideally, all should have the vaccine. Without exception, lahat (all),"" said Duterte. ([PODCAST] Duterte, Trump, Bolsonaro: The 'medical populists')
This departs from his previous speeches when he said wealthy Filipinos will not get such assistance from the government because they can ""buy their own vaccine.""
Duterte reiterated that priority will be given to the poorest Filipino households (specifically those listed as conditional cash transfer beneficiaries), soldiers, and police. The Chief Executive previously said he trusts only the military to distribute the vaccine when it becomes available.
Can the government afford it?
No economic manager was present at the Wednesday meeting. So far, we know that Finance Secretary Carlos Dominguez III targets a P20-billion fund for the purchase of a COVID-19 vaccine.
This fund will come from a loan to be provided by the Land Bank and the Development Bank of the Philippines, two government financial institutions. The loan will be given to the Philippine International Trading Corp, which has been authorized to purchase vaccines for the government.
This fund is to shoulder only an ""initial"" batch of vaccines.
Apart from this, there's a P2.5-billion allocation for vaccines in the proposed 2021 national budget.
Preference for China, Russia vaccines
Though Duterte never lacks in emphasizing his dire need for an effective COVID-19 vaccine, he indicated a preference for certain vaccines in his Wednesday speech.
""Para sa akin (For me), it's either China or Russia, okay na ako (I'm okay with that),"" he said.
""Wala akong – sinasabi nila Pfizer, Moderna, 'yung western, US. Okay rin 'yan kasi may proseso nga eh,"" Duterte continued. (I have nothing – they say Pfizer, Moderna, the western, US. They're also okay because there's a process.)
But he reserved a ringing vote of confidence for a Chinese or Russian vaccine, saying he'd be ""glad to open up [his] sleeves"" for an injection if China or Russia would just give him a call.
""Those of you who are asking if the Chinese vaccines are safe? I can say China is a modern country and it has all the wherewithals to make its country whose integrity is fully protected by its achievement,"" said Duterte.

[PODCAST] Duterte's vaccine dreams vs reality
As for Russia, the President said he had spoken to outgoing Russian Ambassador Igor Khovaev about plans to put up Russian pharmaceutical facilities in the Philippines.
The conversation took place during Khovaev's farewell call to Duterte at the Malacañang Golf Clubhouse earlier that day.
Philippine vaccine experts are still studying documents sent over by Russia's Gamaleya Institute about the Phase 1 and 2 clinical trials of its vaccine, Sputnik V. The expert panel will decide whether or not to green-light Phase 3 clinical trials for the vaccine in the Philippines.
Duterte has declared he has so much confidence in the Russian vaccine that he is willing to be the first to get inoculated with it.
Though Duterte is partial to a China or Russia vaccine, the Philippines is also participating in the Gavi COVID-19 Vaccines Global Access (COVAX) Facility.
Through this initiative, the Philippines is assured a supply of some 20% of its vaccine needs, a supply that would likely include whatever vaccine is proven effective, whether or not from China or Russia.

Dr Gerardo Legaspi, director of the Philippine General Hospital, is the first person to legally receive a COVID-19 vaccine in the Philippines
After weeks of delay, the Philippines finally started its COVID-19 vaccination drive, among the last to do so in Southeast Asia.
Philippine General Hospital (PGH) Director Gerardo ""Dr Gap"" Legaspi was the first to roll up his sleeves as he received his shot of CoronaVac developed by Chinese company Sinovac.
Legaspi is also the first health worker in the country who received a legal COVID-19 vaccine following the unauthorized vaccination of several high-ranking government officials and close-in security personnel of President Rodrigo Duterte.
PGH nurse Chareluck Santos administered the vaccine shot to Legaspi.
Here's what we know about Legaspi:
Legaspi has been into active practice and teaching in neurosurgery for 25 years now.
In the Philippines, he pioneered awake craniotomy surgery, a brain surgery performed on patients who are awake.
His expertise includes treating aneurysms, arteriovenous malformation,brain tumors, congenital malformations of the brain and spinal cord, and skull base surgery.
He is the former president of the the ASEAN Neurosurgical Society and the Academy of Filipino Neurosurgeons Inc.
He has clinics in PGH, St Luke's Medical Center, and the Medical City.
He also works as a consultant in other government institutions as well, like Philippine Children's Medical Center, AFP Medical Center and Davao Regional Hospital in Tagum, Davao del Norte.
After Legaspi received the shot, Filipina actress Saab Magalona recalled how the doctor saved the life of her son after performing two brain surgeries.
Aside from Legaspi, Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Director General Eric Domingo and health department adviser Dr Edsel Salvaña also received their first shot of the Sinovac vaccine.
The kickoff of the mass vaccination drive in the Philippines on Monday, March 1, comes as health workers express reluctance to receive the Sinovac vaccine.
Domingo earlier said that CoronaVac's lower efficacy of 50.4% from trials in Brazil led experts not to recommend its use in the priority sector. The Brazil trials involved health workers exposed to COVID-19.
FDA instead recommended its use to people aged 18 to 59 after separate Phase 3 trials in Indonesia and Turkey demonstrated an efficacy of 65.3% to 91.2%. These trials were done mostly in community settings and not among health workers who were exposed to COVID-19.
The recommendation spurred days-long deliberations among experts belonging to the National Immunization Technical Advisory Group, who later approved the use of the vaccine for health workers, reiterating it is safe and effective. – Rappler.com","{'INSPIRED': 0.42, 'HAPPY': 0.17, 'NEUTRAL': 0.11, 'AMUSED': 0.0, 'ANNOYED': 0.0, 'SAD': 0.0, 'ANGRY': 0.0, 'AFRAID': 0.0}"

Malacañang says President Rodrigo Duterte is the 'best communication tool' to convince many Filipinos to get vaccinated
Malacañang said Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte is willing to go first in line for a COVID-19 vaccine once it is approved for domestic use by the country's Food and Drug Administration (FDA), in order to convince more Filipinos to get immunized.
""Kung papayagan na po ng FDA, I think po mauuna ang Presidente and nag-volunteer naman po siya. In fact, gustong-gusto na niya,"" said Presidential Spokesperson Harry Roque on Monday, December 7, during a press briefing.
(If the FDA will approve, I think the President would go first and he already volunteered. In fact, he really wants it.)
Roque called Duterte the ""best communication tool"" to convince more Filipinos to get vaccinated against COVID-19, amid fears of vaccination programs that grew partly because of the Dengvaxia controversy in 2017.
""Ang Presidente po, naku, hindi na makahintay. Gusto niyang talagang turukan na siya na mapakita sa buong bayan na ligtas at epektibo, ito po’y dumaan sa expert panel group ng pinakadalubhasang Pilipino,"" said the spokesman.
(The President can't wait. He really wants to get vaccinated to show the country that it is safe and effective, it went through a panel composed of Filipino experts.)
In August, Duterte said he was willing to get vaccinated, in public, against SARS-CoV-2 using the Russian-developed Sputnik V.
The FDA has yet to issue Emergency Use Approval (EUA) for any COVID-19 vaccine. But its director general, Eric Domingo, said the process could be as fast as 21 days once a vaccine manufacturer gets an EUA from its home country and submits complete data to the Philippine government.
Domingo's best-case scenario would be a Philippine EUA in January, which could mean distribution starting in March given the capacity of vaccine manufacturers to churn out doses for all the countries which reserved supply.
In the meantime, the national coronavirus task force has determined the 25 million Filipinos who will get vaccinated first. The list is led by medical frontliners and indigent senior citizens.

Roque said the Palace ""welcomes"" the willingness of any other public official to get vaccinated upon issuance of an EUA. But the spokesman also expects criticism should government leaders get access to the vaccines first.
""It's a personal decision of our leaders but if that happens, the government will again be accused of prioritizing VIPs like what happened with the PCR test,"" said the Duterte spokesman.
Back in March, the early days of the pandemic, the Department of Health was criticized for supposedly prioritizing the early release of COVID-19 test results of senators, their spouses, celebrities, and other VIPs.
The hashtag #NoToVIPTesting trended on Twitter amid the scramble for very limited RT-PCR test kits.

Philippine Ambassador to the United States Jose Manuel Romualdez says the companies are willing to set aside 4 to 25 million doses of their respective vaccines
Two more pharmaceutical companies are interested in supplying the Philippines COVID-19 vaccine by the latter half of 2021, Philippine Ambassador to the US Jose Manuel “Babe” Romualdez said on Friday, December 18.Romualdez said US-based Moderna and Arcturus Therapeutics are willing to set aside between 4 to 25 million doses of their vaccines starting in the 3rd quarter of next year “should the Philippine government find their proposals willing.”
“We are hoping our government will consider the promising candidates of Moderna and Arcturus for inclusion in our country’s pool of anti-COVID vaccines,” he said.Moderna is already in the initial negotiation stages with the Philippine government for the possible purchase of its vaccines, while Arcturus has not yet been included in the country’s vaccine portfolio for either trials or procurement.More opportunities
Romualdez’s announcement provides the Philippines with an additional option for vaccines, on top of 22 other potential candidates.Rowena Guevara, Department of Science and Technology Undersecretary for research and development, said the government is interested in multiple vaccines to cover both the need to have different vaccine platforms and ensure adequate supply for the country.Guevara said different kinds of vaccines, such as those that use RNA, live attenuated, or vector vaccine platforms are needed to cater to different kinds of people who would receive the anti-COVID shot.“Right now we are more worried about the supply because if you look at the availability of these vaccines that are ready for 2021, it is not enough for the entire world population. We have to prioritize and to that effect, we need to make sure we can get as many vaccines as we can from all the types of platforms,"" she added.
A recent study published in the BMJ medical journal found that based on advance purchase commitments, high income countries already reserved over half of doses to be supplied by 13 leading manufacturers.“Even if all 13 of these vaccine manufacturers were to succeed in reaching their maximum production capacity, at least a fifth of the world’s population would not have access to vaccines until 2022,” it said. – Rappler.com","{'SAD': 0.24, 'NEUTRAL': 0.2, 'HAPPY': 0.19, 'INSPIRED': 0.0, 'AMUSED': 0.0, 'ANNOYED': 0.0, 'ANGRY': 0.0, 'AFRAID': 0.0}"

Finance Secretary Carlos Dominguez III says the fund will be enough to vaccinate 60 million Filipinos. Is this enough to attain herd immunity?
The Philippines aims to come up with P73.2 billion ($1.5 billion) to pay for the COVID-19 vaccinations of 60 million Filipinos, Finance Secretary Carlos Dominguez III said in a meeting with President Rodrigo Duterte on Monday, November 23.
""P73.2 billion financing that's pretty much – most of it is already fixed,"" he told Duterte and other Cabinet members who met in Davao City to discuss measures against the pandemic and other issues.
Dominguez spelled out the sources of this fund.
""Low cost, long-term"" loans from multilateral agencies like Asian Development Bank and World Bank - P40 billion
Domestic sources like LandBank, Development Bank of the Philippines, and government corporations - P20 billion
Bilateral sources from countries where a vaccine is being developed - P13.2 billion
The finance chief, however, tempered expectations, saying the P13.2 billion funds estimated to come from bilateral arrangements is ""not completely negotiated.""
$25 to vaccinate one Filipino
Dominguez estimated that it would cost an average of $25 or P1,200 to vaccinate one Filipino.
This would mean that with a P73.2 billion budget, the government will be able to pay for the vaccination of 60 million Filipinos or slightly less than 60% of the country's population.
Health Secretary Francisco Duque III backed up Dominguez, saying this number of inoculated Filipinos is enough to achieve herd immunity, or the resistance of a community to a disease due to immunity of a high-proportion of its people.
""Herd immunity, Mr President, is anywhere from 60% to 70%, according to the World Health Organization. If we’re able to reach that, we’re going to pretty much arrest the spread of this and mawawala yung COVID-19 sa ating lipunan (and COVID-19 will disappear from our society),"" said Duque.
""So basically, 60 million [people] is okay and we have funds for that,"" said Dominguez in response.
Studies on vaccines say that the percentage of a population required to achieve herd immunity will largely depend on how effective the vaccine is.
In the same meeting, vaccine czar Carlito Galvez Jr said his strategy for distributing the vaccine would be to prioritize doses for coronavirus ""hotspots"" like Metro Manila, Davao City, Bacolod City, and others.
Then the vulnerable sectors in these cities or provinces would be given the vaccines first – poor households, health workers, military and police.
The proposed 2021 budget contains only P2.5 billion for COVID-19 vaccine procurement, disappointing several lawmakers.
The Department of Health has estimated that it needs around P12.9 billion to meet the target of vaccinating at least 20% of the entire population for free. (READ: DOH short of P10 billion for COVID-19 vaccines)
Status of vaccine negotiations
The government is already negotiating with 4 vaccine developers – Pfizer (US), AstraZeneca (United Kingdom), Sinovac (China), and Janssen (US), said Galvez.
By the end of November, the government will be able to provide its Advance Market Commitment to these firms to reserve a supply of their vaccine, he added.
Galvez was most optimistic about the arrangements for the AstraZeneca vaccine, saying the firm is setting aside 20 million doses for the Philippines and that it is the most affordable, costing ""more or less $5.""
If all goes goes smoothly, said Galvez, distribution of the 20 million doses in the Philippines may take place in the second quarter of 2021 or during the months of April to June. – Rappler.com","{'HAPPY': 0.26, 'NEUTRAL': 0.23, 'ANGRY': 0.12, 'INSPIRED': 0.12, 'AMUSED': 0.0, 'ANNOYED': 0.0, 'SAD': 0.0, 'AFRAID': 0.0}"

The plan, created by Duterte's pandemic task force, was to get high-ranking government officials and celebrities vaccinated to increase vaccine acceptance among Filipinos
Vaccine experts advising the government's pandemic response thumbed down the Duterte administration's plan to reserve 50 CoronaVac vaccines for ""influencers,"" insisting that these should go to medical frontliners who urgently need them.
Presidential Spokesman Harry Roque cited this as the reason why he has decided not to get vaccinated with the Sinovac vaccine, despite earlier pronouncements that he was raring to get the jab.
""Tatapatin ko po kayo. Kami po sa IATF ay nagpropose ng mga 50 ng mga bakuna i-reserve para sa mga influencers namapaigting natin ang ating vaccine confidence. Hindi po sumang-ayon ang iNITAG. Ako po’y sumusunod naman,"" said Roque on Tuesday, March 2.
(I will be frank with you. We in the IATF proposed that 50 vaccines be reserved for influencers in order to boost vaccine confidence. iNITAG did not agree. I abided by this.)
iNITAG – the Interim National Immunization Technical Advisory Group for COVID-19 vaccines – is a group of vaccine and health experts who provide guidance and recommendations to the Inter-Agency Task Force on Emerging Infectious Diseases (IATF-EID).
The day before, the government officially kicked off its anti-COVID-19 vaccination drive, putting Sinovac vaccines into the arms of medical personnel in COVID-19 referral hospitals in Metro Manila.
Who were the 'influencers'?
Roque said the task force did not have specific names of who would get the 50 vaccines. But they planned to include President Rodrigo Duterte, Cabinet members, certain members of the House of Representatives, senators, and even media personalities and celebrities.
Duterte had already agreed to get vaccinated in public to increase vaccine acceptance among Filipinos but he would not be getting CoronaVac as the Food and Drug Administration does not recommend it for persons above 59 years old.
'Exceptions'
However, government officials who are non-medical frontliners managed to get vaccinated on Monday, despite the iNITAG position, including COVID-19 plan chief implementer and vaccine czar Carlito Galvez Jr, deputy chief implementer and testing czar Vince Dizon, and Metropolitan Manila Development Authority chairman Benhur Abalos Jr.
Roque said these 3 were exceptions to the iNITAG decision because Duterte had explicitly told Galvez and Dizon to get vaccinated, and because Abalos is ""representative of all the mayors"" in pandemic epicenter Metro Manila.
Duterte, said his spokesman, is asking for the understanding of mayors who expected to get a Sinovac vaccine to boost vaccine acceptance in their cities.
FDA Director General Eric Domingo was also given a vaccine because ""the effect of his vaccination will boost confidence because he won't approve something that will be bad for him,"" said Roque.
The Duterte spokesman himself was seen in the pre-screening area during the vaccinations at the Philippine General Hospital where he held a press conference on the vaccinations kick-off.
However, Roque said he ended up not getting a shot that day because the hospital had run out of doses allocated for the day. He had made no mention of the iNITAG decision.
But on Tuesday, the iNITAG decision was apparently a major factor in his decision to abort getting injected.
""News came to me that iNITAG is really against it so to avoid controversy, did not push through with it, and it's true that they lacked vaccines,"" Roque said in Filipino.
Vaccine rejection among Filipinos rose steadily in the weeks preceding the arrival of the country's first COVID-19 vaccines.
A survey conducted by the Octa Research Group from January 1 to February 26 showed that nearly half or 46% of Filipinos said they wouldn't get vaccinated. – Rappler.com","{'ANGRY': 0.31, 'ANNOYED': 0.23, 'AMUSED': 0.22, 'INSPIRED': 0.0, 'HAPPY': 0.0, 'NEUTRAL': 0.0, 'SAD': 0.0, 'AFRAID': 0.0}"

'Wala pong pilian,' says Presidential Spokesperson Harry Roque as the government announces that a Chinese vaccine could be the first to be rolled out to priority groups
Health workers, elderly, and indigent persons who refuse to be given the first COVID-19 vaccine to be offered to them by the government will lose their priority slot and wait for another vaccine along with the general population, said Malacañang on Monday, January 11.
The policy was explained by Presidential Spokesperson Harry Roque after news broke that a Chinese vaccine could be the first to be given to priority groups as early as February, if regulatory agencies approve.
Roque said that those who reject an offered vaccine will be asked to sign a waiver signifying their refusal to get the free jabs.
""Wala pong pilian, wala kasing pilitan. Pero magsa-sign ka ng waiver na hindi ka nagpaturok,"" he said during a Palace press briefing.
(No choosing, because there's no forcing. But you'll sign a waiver that you decided not to get vaccinated.)
""At kung mayroon kang prayoridad, siyempre, mawawala 'yung prayoridad mo, sasama ka sa the rest of the taumbayan na naghihintay ng bakuna,"" he continued.
(And if you're in the priority groups, of course, your priority slot would be gone, you would have to join the rest of the population waiting for a vaccine.)
Roque said this policy is ""only right"" because the government won't be able to choose which COVID-19 vaccine will be immediately available to the Philippines since this is partly dependent on supplies of vaccine developers.
""We all have rights to good health, but you can't choose because so many Filipinos need to be vaccinated,"" said the Duterte spokesman.
This vaccine policy has yet to be formalized in a task force resolution, but Roque said officials have reached a ""consensus"" on it.
Order of vaccines arrival
The first batch of COVID-19 vaccines to arrive in the Philippines will likely be CoronaVac, the vaccine developed by Chinese firm Sinovac. An initial batch of 50,000 doses is expected to arrive in February, with batches arriving throughout the year until arrivals reach 25 million doses in December.
Because CoronaVac requires two doses, this amount is only good for 12.5 million Filipinos, roughly half of the 24.6 million Filipinos in the priority list of the government.
What could fill in the gap are the other vaccines the government is trying to secure but are set to arrive later in the year. The first batch of 30 million doses of Covovax, the vaccine of American firm Novavax, is expected to arrive around July to September. Around this time also, doses of AstraZeneca vaccines, secured by Philippine private firms and various local governments, are seen to arrive.
All of those vaccine rollouts will depend on the issuance of an emergency use authorization (EUA) by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Without an EUA, none of the vaccines can be administered.
So far, only AstraZeneca, Pfizer, and Russia's Gamaleya Institute – developer of the Sputnik V vaccine – have applied for an EUA.
Roque, however, said he expects Sinovac to submit its application in the next few days.
Trust in vaccines
Some Phase 3 trials of the Sinovac vaccine have shown an efficacy of 78%, a better rating than the AstraZeneca vaccine. But details from these trials remain unpublished at this time. (READ: [ANALYSIS] The Chinese COVID-19 vaccines, Sinopharm and Sinovac, are effective)
Since July, it's been used in China for vulnerable sectors. However, no stringent regulatory agency, like the World Health Organization, European Union, or United States agencies have approved this vaccine.
But countries where clinical trials were performed, like Indonesia, Turkey, and Brazil, are expected to issue emergency use approval soon.
Roque said the government would wait for the Philippine FDA to issue an EUA before administering Sinovac's vaccine to Filipinos. If the doses arrive in February without an EUA, the government would accept the doses but keep them until an EUA is issued. – Rappler.com","{'ANGRY': 0.45, 'ANNOYED': 0.12, 'SAD': 0.1, 'NEUTRAL': 0.1, 'INSPIRED': 0.0, 'HAPPY': 0.0, 'AMUSED': 0.0, 'AFRAID': 0.0}"

A timeline shared by Health Secretary Francisco Duque III shows how a mix of red tape and unfamiliarity with new vaccine technology slowed down the process of securing a purchase deal long before it could even start
From the early days of the pandemic, President Rodrigo Duterte has repeatedly touted the need for a vaccine to salvage the country from COVID-19.Several of the Chief Executive’s speeches have been peppered with statements on the much-needed relief a vaccine would bring to the economy, along with promises to inoculate the entire population for free.But new details shared by Health Secretary Francisco Duque III showed it took the Duterte administration about 4 to 5 months to sign a confidentiality data agreement (CDA) that would cover negotiations with vaccine developer Pfizer, raising questions about whether government officials moved fast enough to secure for the country the scarce supply.From when Pfizer officials approached the Philippine government in late June to start discussions on its vaccine candidates, it was only in late October, or 4 months after, that the CDA, a preliminary document, was signed. With other government officials like vaccine czar Carlito Galvez Jr, the timeline stretched further to November when a CDA was finalized.Duque detailed the timeline of critical dates in the government’s dealings with Pfizer officials in response to allegations that he bungled a deal to secure the vaccine supplies by January.The health secretary found himself on the defense after Foreign Secretary Teodoro Locsin Jr posted a cryptic tweet that an offer brokered by him, Philippine Ambassador to the US Jose Manuel ""Babe"" Romualdez, and US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo would have locked in 10 million doses of the vaccine by as early as January 2021 “but that somebody dropped the ball.”“I have the chronology of events so that this is all documented. So there is no such thing as 'I did not act quick enough,'” Duque said in an interview on ANC Headstart on Thursday, December 17.MUST READ
Locsin shares foiled plan to secure 10M Pfizer vaccine doses by January
Red tape
What Duque’s timeline does show is how a mix of bureaucratic red tape, coupled with the uncertainty of a new vaccine, hampered the process of negotiating a purchase deal long before it could even start.In the case of a CDA – a preliminary document that would allow scientists to review Pfizer’s vaccine development data – signing this would be the first step in opening negotiations on the possible securement of doses.
Yetgovernment agencies passed the buck in signing a CDA on behalf of the Philippine government.First, from the DOH, Duque said an inter-agency task force resolution mandated that Pfizer’s overview on its vaccines should be given to the Department of Science and Technology-Philippine Council for Health Research and Development as the lead agency in vaccine assessment.This differed from the preference of Pfizer, which initially wanted the Office of the President to sign the CDA on behalf of the government. It would take another month for the Office of the Executive Secretary (OES) to designate the DOH as signatory.While the period for signing a CDA varies for the parties involved and terms being discussed, the global race to secure limited vaccine supplies has underscored the need not just for money, but agility from governments to move on locking down purchase deals. In a pandemic where hundreds may become ill or die in a single day, time is a precious resource.
How much of a factor was red tape in the weeks it took the government to sign a CDA with Pfizer? Duque was evasive, saying a new vaccine should afford the government some “allowance.”
“You have to give allowances to the fact that, I for one, this is my first time to have signed a CDA. So I have to be very, very cautious in what I am signing to ensure the government’s interest is first and foremost protected. That there are no onerous provisions,” Duque said.Asked why the OES, on behalf of the OP, passed on the responsibly to the DOH, Duque said the decision was also fueled by caution.“It was his judgment that because (a) vaccine is health-related, it was directly aligned to the mandate of the DOH. So that reason is well grounded,” he said.On the other hand, the health secretary said the process for evaluating vaccines was also revised in the context of the pandemic.Whereas the DOH was usually the only agency that assessed vaccines to be used in the Philippines, the inter-agency task force agreed the DOST would lead reviews through an expert panel focused on the scientific assessment of a COVID-19 vaccine.The arrangement, though well-intended, exposed how added layers of screening could prove detrimental if not optimized for a highly competitive vaccine like Pfizer and BioNTech’s.“Medyo talagang nung una, nagkakaproblema kasi (At the start, this was a problem because) if we follow the process, dapat nga 'yan (that should be) DOST, based on the IATF. It was Pfizer that wanted the Office of the President,” Duque said.MUST READ

Balancing act
This battle against time had to contend with the uncertainty over a new vaccine.As a public official, Duque said protocols must be followed and that “we cannot just be buying a vaccine like chocolate.” Further, as a medical professional, Duque said his principle was to remain prudent. “My overriding principle in my practice of medicine is always to err on the side of caution,” he said.For Duque, another factor that influenced his actions was the memory of the Dengvaxia scandal that tanked child immunization rates in the Philippines. The aftermath took its toll on children as the Philippines experienced a measles and polio outbreak it continues to address until today.
“There are too many unknowns and that’s why I said earlier, my overriding principle is, we have to be cautious with the health and lives of our people. We have long experience with different vaccines and we don’t want a repeat of very costly lessons we experienced in the past with some of the vaccines,” he said.The following key dates, as enumerated by Duque, detail this process:(We have included all dates mentioned, along with Duque’s description of events that took place on specific dates.)
June 24, 2020 -Pfizer sends an overview of its candidate vaccine development and manufacturing program to the Philippine government.June 29, 2020 - DOH, through its pharmaceutical division, refers the proposal to the Department of Science and Technology-Philippine Council for Health Research and Development (DOST-PCHRD) as the lead agency in the management of vaccine development for COVID-19 response.August 6 - DOH sends a letter to Pfizer reiterating that its overview should be given to the DOST.August 7 - A meeting is held between Pfizer and DOH officials to discuss the use of its mRNA or messenger RNA technology in the company’s potential COVID-19 vaccine.Duque said that this meeting is where he raised many questions on the use of mRNA vaccines and whether or not these have been deployed in different countries. “And they said yes for HIV-AIDS and that’s about it. There has been no experience; DOH neither has experience in these long years of its immunization program, we never had this kind of technology,” he said.August 11 - Pfizer sends a draft CDA to the DOH.Duque said the CDA was initially meant to be signed by the Office of the Executive Secretary (OES) on behalf of all government agencies.This arrangement would have eliminated the need for multiple government agencies to sign their own CDA with Pfizer. In a recent forum, the DOH said that they were trying to streamline the current setup which saw different agencies each having their own CDAs.August 26 - DOH re-endorses to Pfizer comments from “relevant technical offices” in the Philippine government.Duque said he cannot disclose details of the agreement or its provisions as he is bound by the CDA.
September 4 - Pfizer meets with key DOH and DOST officials, as well as Executive Secretary Salvador Medialdea to provide updates on their vaccine development.At this time, Duque said Pfizer explained it had two candidates qualified in terms of a safety and efficacy profile after Phase 1 and 2 trials.He also said this is when the company disclosed it had the potential supply of 100 million doses by the end of 2020, though this would be subject to regulatory approval. The company added it had a projected production of 1.3 billion doses by 2021, he added.Duque claimed 10 million doses were said to be set aside for the world market “outside of those that were given to the originating countries like the US,” in effect, disputing Locsin’s claim that the amount was offered specifically to the Philippines.Aside from this, Duque said the company was not interested in conducting Phase 3 trials– something the country preferred so that it could clear the vaccine for “ethnic diversity.” Researchers often test medicines on diverse populations as not all race and ethnic groups will respond the same way to medicines and potential side effects.On Friday, December 16, Locsin maintained an offer from the US had been made on Pfizer's vaccine but that it has since gone to Singapore.
September 11 - Pfizer receives the DOH’s comments on the CDADuque said there was a back and forth between the government and Pfizer officials on certain provisions that were supposedly “one-sided.”“This is not as simple as drafting a document for a medicine or vaccine that you’ve used in the past,” he said in Filipino.September 14 - Duque receives a revised draft CDA with revisions from the office of the deputy executive secretary. He says he also forwarded a summary of revisions from Pfizer and the DOH, among others.September 17 - The DOH sends a letter to the OES on the CDA. Reviews take place over the next few days.
September 24 - Pfizer sends an email to the DOH, saying it had been advised by the Office of the President, through the office of the executive secretary, that the DOH will be the signatory to the CDA. The company also requests for a coordination meeting. “So we met immediately,” Duque said.September 25 - The DOH responds to hold a meeting with Pfizer.Duque said this was needed since Pfizer initially wanted the President’s office to sign the CDA.“Hindi nga ako pupuwede mag-sign (I really cannot sign) for the national government. I can only sign for the DOH. And that is why it is small wonder that DOST also signed in November a separate CDA with Pfizer. Even Secretary Galvez signed a separate CDA with Pfizer also in November,” Duque said on Thursday.October 20 - Duque signs the CDA with Pfizer.According to him, Pfizer agreed that the DOH could sign on behalf of the government, on the condition that it would sign separate CDAs with different agencies as needed.Significant deal
While negotiations are ongoing between Pfizer officials and the Philippine government, what may have been a possible delay in signing necessary documents could prove costly for Filipinos.
Though Pfizer’s vaccine possessed a logistical headache for the Philippines, it has a strategic position in attaining emergency authorization from the FDA.For one, the US FDA has issued its own emergency authorization for the vaccine – a major factor and requirement to attaining a similar emergency clearance from the Philippines. This is buoyed by several clearances that regulatory agencies in countries like Canada and the United Kingdom have granted the company.Pfizer and BioNTech’s vaccine was also the first to show promising results of 95% efficacy. This was announced on November 18.
Meanwhile, for all of the health secretary's uncertainty on the vaccine, a CDA could have covered in part, if not full, a review of scientific and trial data that would shed light on the way the vaccine worked. Duque mentioned that the agreement was to facilitate the sharing of data.

On how soon these may be deployed, Galvez said Pfizer's vaccine may arrive in the country by the 3rd quarter of 2021 at the earliest, along with the bulk of other vaccines eyed by the Philippines.On Thursday, December 17, Senator Francis Pangilinan said that if it can be established that a government official ""inexcusably"" failed to act, then he may be sued under Republic Act 3019 or the Anti-graft law.Specifically, Section 3(e) of RA 3019 listed corrupt actions to include:
“Causing any undue injury to any party, including the Government, or giving any private party any unwarranted benefits, advantage or preference in the discharge of his official administrative or judicial functions through manifest partiality, evident bad faith or gross inexcusable negligence.”
Former Supreme Court spokesperson Ted Te also said non-feasance or the failure to perform duty by a public official “amounts to an offense cognizable by the Ombudsman.”MUST READ

‘We have been developing our own vaccine for the past 3 months,’ says Indonesian President Joko Widodo
No, they’re not just waiting for vaccines from China or Russia.
Unlike the Philippines, Indonesia is developing its own coronavirus vaccine, which the country expects to complete by mid-2021.
“We have been developing our own vaccine for the past 3 months, specifically from the COVID-19 virus strain spread in Indonesia. Hopefully the vaccine will be ready soon and it (vaccine development) is expected to be completed by mid-2021,” said Indonesian President Joko Widodo, as quoted by the Jakarta Post on Tuesday, August 11.
Jokowi was speaking at the launch of the vaccine’s late-stage human trials, the Jakarta Post said. The vaccine is being developed by the Indonesian state-owned enterprise Bio Farma in partnership with Sinovac Biotech of China.
“We are proud that a state-owned enterprise like Bio Farma in partnership with Sinovac Biotech of China are able to begin phase III clinical trials. Not many countries or institutions have been able to reach this stage,” said Indonesia’s State-Owned Enterprises Minister Erick Thohir.
This is part of Indonesia’s long-term strategy to fight COVID-19, knowing it might be difficult to gain access to other countries’ vaccines.“Therefore, it is necessary for Indonesia to develop its own COVID-19 vaccine. And it will be by Indonesia, from Indonesia, to Indonesia,” said Ali Ghufron Mukti of Indonesia’s research and technology ministry, in another Jakarta Post report.
In contrast, the Philippines, which has invested little in scientific research through the years, concedes it has no means to produce its own vaccine. Instead it is banking on a short-term strategy of joining clinical trials of other countries – a move Indonesia is also taking.

Health Undersecretary Maria Rosario Vergeire says that for now, they only have an 'indicative' schedule of the arrival of the vaccine doses
The Department of Health (DOH) said on Wednesday, February 10, that there is ""no confirmed date"" yet on the arrival of COVID-19 vaccines as the country prepares for its vaccination program.
Health Undersecretary Maria Rosario Vergeire said in a virtual press briefing that what Gavi vaccine alliance COVAX facility told them was an ""indicative date"" or tentative schedule, which is the 2nd or 3rd week of February.
""The February 15 is an indicative date, when we say indicative date that is tentative schedule. No confirmed date yet on when are we going to start,"" she said in a mix of English and Filipino.
Vergeire issued the statement when asked about the arrival of the vaccines in the country so as not to give ""false hopes"" to Filipinos. She added that they will give the exact date of the start of the vaccination program once they get the confirmation of the vaccine arrival.
This comes after Presidential Spokesperson Harry Roque announced that the government would be ready to start its vaccination program by February 15. He later clarified though that start of vaccination will still depend on the arrival of the vaccines from the COVAX facility.
Though they could not give the exact date of the vaccination program, the government – led by vaccine czar Carlito Galvez – on Tuesday held a simulation exercise of the vaccine arrival in the country, including the pickup of the vaccine supplies from the airport.Vergeire said the simulation was done to avoid vaccine wastage.
Meanwhile, the DOH said on Monday that that all vaccine operation centers in local government units located in Metro Manila, Central Visayas, and Davao should be fully activated by February 10.– Rappler.com

But the American firm will prioritize vaccine doses for the United States, which has paid almost $2 billion for 100 million doses, says Ambassador Jose Manuel Romualdez
Philippine Ambassador to the United States Jose Manuel ""Babe"" Romualdez said American pharmaceutical company Pfizer will ensure supply for the Philippines of its COVID-19 vaccine after it is approved for distribution.
His assurance comes after Pfizer announced that its vaccine candidate proved 90% effective in an initial study of its Phase 3 clinical trials, a ray of hope for people all over the world weary of the ongoing pandemic.
""As long as they get approval and we tell them what we need, they're ready to supply it,"" said Romualdez on Monday, November 9. A video of his remarks were shown to the Malacañang Press Corps on Tuesday.
The Philippines and other countries, however, may have to wait a little longer as Pfizer is prioritizing the United States for its vaccine production this year.
""Of course, their production this year, the United States will go first because they need 100 million vaccine [doses],"" said Romualdez in Filipino.
The ambassador pegged the cost of the Pfizer vaccine at $5 a shot, or around P240 a shot.
The US government had ordered 100 million doses of the vaccine for $1.95 billion, which puts the price per dose at $19.50.
Pfizer, said Romualdez, was the first American pharmaceutical firm to get in touch with him. He had been contact with other companies like Moderna ""3 to 4 months ago"" and these talks were supposedly the fruit of discussions between Philippine Foreign Secretary Teodoro Locsin Jr and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo last April.
When will it arrive in the Philippines?
Romualdez estimates that, if all is smooth-sailing, the Pfizer vaccine could get approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration within the year and Philippine FDA approval early next year.
This could then mean an initial batch of the Pfizer vaccine arriving in the Philippines ""by early next year"" or ""first quarter"" of next year.
Romualdez said Pfizer has not asked for any ""downpayment"" but only a ""purchase order"" signifying the Philippine government's commitment to buy a certain amount of vaccine doses.
Another way a supply of the Pfizer vaccine could reach the country is through the Philippine private sector. Romualdez said Filipino businessmen have expressed willingness to pay for the vaccines so they can provide these to their employees.
Duterte's economic managers are targeting a fund of P20 billion to be used to purchase COVID-19 vaccines, likely from a variety of suppliers.
This fund will come from a loan to be provided by the Land Bank and the Development Bank of the Philippines, two government financial institutions. The loan will be given to the Philippine International Trading Corp, which has been authorized to purchase vaccines for the government.
This fund is to shoulder only an ""initial"" batch of vaccines.
Apart from this, there's a P2.5-billion allocation for vaccines in the proposed 2021 national budget.
The economic team will have to look for more funding sources after Duterte promised to shoulder the cost of vaccines for all 107 million Filipinos. – Rappler.com","{'HAPPY': 0.47000000000000003, 'INSPIRED': 0.26, 'NEUTRAL': 0.1, 'AMUSED': 0.0, 'ANNOYED': 0.0, 'SAD': 0.0, 'ANGRY': 0.0, 'AFRAID': 0.0}"

'Instead of aiming at the hoop, he scratched his balls so he dropped the ball even as time was running out,' says Senator Panfilo Lacson in a cryptic tweet
The Philippines would have been in line to receive 10 million doses of Pfizer’s COVID-19 vaccine in January 2021, if Health Secretary Francisco Duque III had not “dropped the ball” on an arrangement passed onto him by other officials, said Senator Panfilo Lacson.
In a cryptic tweet on Thursday, December 17, Lacson shared what he called a “direct quote.”
“In July, we passed the ball to him. Instead of aiming at the hoop, he scratched his balls so he dropped the ball even as time was running out. Then, Singapore grabbed and shot the ball,” Lacson said.
The senator then capped off his tweet, “Now, they have the vaccines and we don’t.”
Rappler asked Lacson to clarify whom he was quoting in his tweet, but he has yet to reply to our query as of this posting.
However, the previous night, he sent reporters a message in which he mentioned Duque in relation to an earlier tweet by Foreign Secretary Teodoro Locsin Jr, who said someone had “dropped the ball” in making arrangements with Pfizer for the vaccines.

Locsin shares foiled plan to secure 10M Pfizer vaccine doses by January
Citing a phone conversation he had with Philippine Ambassador to the US Jose Manuel “Babe” Romualdez, Lacson said Locsin and US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo were already negotiating “as early as July,” as arranged by Romualdez.
“Thus, they could have secured the delivery of 10 million Pfizer vaccines as early as January next year, way ahead of Singapore, but for the indifference of Secretary Duque, who failed to work on the necessary documentary requirement namely, the Confidentiality Disclosure Agreement (CDA) as he should have done,” Lacson said.
Even Pfizer’s country representative had been following up on the CDA but to no avail, he added.
Lacson then lamented how many lives will have been saved if the Pfizer vaccines were made available to Filipinos by January 2021. Although Duque claimed ongoing talks between the pharmaceutical company and the government, Lacson said the Philippines already missed what would have been the early first salvo of deliveries of the vaccines.
If it is true that Duque “dropped the ball” in arrangements for the Pfizer vaccine, then he may be sued for “gross and inexcusable negligence under the anti-graft law,” said Senator Francis Pangilinan on Thursday.
The Senate Committee of the Whole is set to hold a legislative inquiry into the government’s plans on rolling out COVID-19 vaccines. Pangilinan said this will be crucial not only in checking the readiness of those plans, but also in ferreting out any attempts at overpricing.
“Millions of lives are at stake here,” Pangilinan said.
Duque on Wednesday denied he had been negligent in the matter, and said negotiations with Pfizer for the vaccines are still underway.
Peace Process Secretary Carlito Galvez Jr, the country’s COVID-19 vaccine czar and chief implementer of policies on the pandemic, earlier said Pfizer's vaccine may arrive in the Philippines by the 3rd quarter of 2021 at the earliest, along with the bulk of other vaccines eyed by the government.

Philippine vaccine czar Carlito Galvez Jr said COVID-19 vaccines developed by United States drugmaker Pfizer, China's Sinovac, and the United Kingdom's AstraZeneca may be among the first to arrive in the Philippines.
Galvez identified the 3 vaccines based on the current status of negotiations that the government is holding with pharmaceutical companies and multilateral initiatives, including international group GAVI's COVAX facility.
The COVAX facility guarantees access to a portfolio of vaccines and doses for at least 20% of the population of participating countries. It is run by GAVI, The Vaccine Alliance; the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations; and the World Health Organization (WHO).
""The 3 vaccines that will arrive first either way – if we can negotiate an early rollout – first, Pfizer, second, Sinovac, and then AstraZeneca,"" Galvez said in a virtual briefing on Wednesday, January 13.He earlier announced that the Duterte government could begin distributing COVID-19 vaccines to the public as soon as February, when the first doses of either Sinovac or Pfizer's vaccine arrive.

During the briefing, Galvez also defended the government's negotiations after lawmakers questioned why Sinovac is among the vaccine brands favored for procurement despite its reportedly higher price compared to other brands.
Galvez said that during negotiations, price points being offered were much lower than market prices which are publicly available. He declined to divulge Sinovac's exact price as talks with the company are bound by confidentiality agreements until a deal is finalized.Instead, Galvez described Sinovac's price to be midrange, supposedly cheaper than those being offered by American pharmaceutical firms.

Once nakakuha na sila ng (they have the) EUA , for example in the US FDA, mas mapapabilis talaga ang proseso (the process will quicken). We’re able to look at the evaluation that are done by these mature and advanced regulatory agencies,"" Domingo said.
Malacañang said on Thursday, November 19, that Duterte already approved ""in principle"" the request of the health department for an EUA.
An EUA would speed up the processing time for approval of COVID-19 vaccines that would enter the country – from 6 months to 21 days.
It would be an order from the President to create an express lane that would skip the usual red tape and load of paperwork which bog down vaccine purchases.
Earlier, DOH assured the public that fast-tracking would not mean compromising on quality studies.
""We have the vaccine expert panel at the start, and the FDA would continuously monitor this technology kahit nabigyan na nila ng rehistro sa ating bansa (even though they are already registered in our country),"" said Health Undersecretary Maria Rosario Vergeire in a previous briefing.
In September, the FDA said that in a ""best case scenario,"" the earliest possible availability of a coronavirus vaccine in the Philippines would be by April 2021.
On Tuesday, November 17, Pfizer's Albert Bourla said that they were ""very close"" to applying for an emergency use approval for its COVID-19 vaccine after collecting safety data to submit to US regulators.
Moderna has previously said it expects to apply for an EUA by November 25.
The Philippines is currently looking at 17 possible sources of vaccines from various countries. Out of the 17, 9 are now undergoing the 3rd phase of trials, with Pfizer and Moderna reporting promising results, both with 95% efficacy in their phase 3 clinical trials results.

Meanwhile, trial site preparations are ongoing for Sinovac and Clover Biopharmaceuticals
Janssen Pharmaceutica has started Phase 3 clinical trials of its COVID-19 vaccines in the country, Department of Science and Technology (DOST) Undersecretary Rowena Guevara said.
Guevara made the announcement in a virtual press briefing on Friday, February 19, adding that she could not disclose further details of the trials.
""'Yung sa cities, nabigay na namin 'yan last time. 'Yung number [of partipcants] po ay hindi po namin puwede i-reveal; Janssen po ang puwede magsabi niyan,"" she added. (We've already provided [which cities will participate] last time. We cannot disclose the number of participants; only Janssen is authorized to do so.)
The DOST earlier said that the following cities were the target sites of the Janssen trials: San Pablo, Laguna; Cabuyao, Laguna; Makati City; La Paz, Iloilo; and Bacolod City.
Clinical trials are a type of research which evaluates potential medical interventions that affect one's health. During trials, medicines, treatments, procedures, and devices may be tested to study or verify their clinical or pharmacological effects before they are approved for public use.
Janssen, the pharmaceutical firm of Johnson & Johnson, is developing a vaccine using a ""non-replicating viral vector"" called Adenovirus 26, whichhas been genetically engineered so it can still invade cells but can’t replicate and cause disease. The company used the same method to develop vaccines for Ebola and other diseases.Unlike most other candidates, Janssen’s vaccine utilizes a single dose. Despite this, the company said it would use some Phase 3 trials to study the effects of two doses given 56 days apart.Its vaccine can also be stored in standard refrigerated facilities, making the prospect of distributing and administering vaccines easier for lower income countries like the Philippines.Meanwhile, Guevara said that trial site preparations are ongoing for Sinovac and Clover Biopharmaceuticals.
Though it could not give the exact date of the arrival of vaccines in the country, the government said that the vaccination program would start this February.
The pandemic has infected over 110 million people globally. As of Thursday, February 18, the Philippines has 555,163 cases, with 11,673 deaths and 512,375 recoveries. – Rappler.com

The original version of the bill would have allowed LGUs to directly buy COVID-19 vaccines from manufacturers
Lawmakers agreed to strike out their proposal to allow local government units (LGUs) to directly buy coronavirus vaccines from manufacturers in the bill aimed at expediting the procurement process.
On Wednesday, February 17, Rappler obtained a copy of the committee report on House Bill (HB) No. 8648 that was approved by the committee on appropriations.
The amendments were later finalized when HB No. 8648 was brought to the House plenary for its period of debates and period of amendments on Wednesday afternoon.
The bill will have to be approved on 2nd and 3rd readings before hurdling the House.
The amended version of HB No. 8648 essentially retained the current policy of the National Task Force Against COVID-19 (NTF) stating that LGUs can reserve vaccine supplies only by signing tripartite deals with the national government and the manufacturer concerned.
Section 3(c) of the bill now reads: LGUs ""may purchase, only in cooperation with the DOH (Department of Health) and NTF Against COVID-19, through a multiparty agreement which shall include the DOH and the relevant supplier of COVID-19 vaccine or ancillary supplies or services.""
This is a major amendment to the original version of HB No. 8648 that was earlier approved in principle by the panel, since the measure would have allowed LGUs to directly buy COVID-19 vaccines straight from manufacturers.
Some of the country’s top medical experts had strongly opposed this because it would lead to a ""maldistribution"" of COVID-19 vaccines, where richer LGUs with the capacity to pay would get priority access, leaving poorer communities further behind.
Tax exemptions, no public bidding
Still, HB No. 8648 aims to expedite the vaccine procurement process in the Philippines by authorizing the DOH and the NTF to engage in ""negotiated procurement under emergency cases"" for the COVID-19 vaccines to be distributed to LGUs.Negotiated procurement would allow the DOH and the NTF to directly negotiate a contract with a capable supplier to speed up the process.
The bill likewise grants tax exemptions on the COVID-19 vaccines to be procured.It would also waive the Phase IV clinical trial requirement for COVID-19 medication and vaccines, but the drugs should still be recommended by the World Health Organization and/or other internationally recognized health agencies.Under the bill’s multiparty deal scheme, LGUs would only be allowed to purchase COVID-19 vaccines that have already been registered with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) or have been issued emergency use authorization (EUA).
So far, only the vaccines created by Pfizer-BioNTech and AstraZeneca have secured EUAs from the FDA.HB No. 8648 also creates an indemnification fund to shoulder the medical costs of an individual who would experience ""adverse events"" after getting the COVID-19 vaccine. The bill, however, has not yet specified the exact amount for the fund or where it would be sourced.
The Senate version of the bill is more specific, allotting a P500-million COVID-19 indemnification fund that would be sourced from the Contingent Fund under the 2021 national budget.
If passed into law, the bill's provisions would be valid during the state of calamity and public health emergency that was declared due to COVID-19 or until June 30, 2022 – that is unless President Rodrigo Duterte lifts the state of emergency or extends it. – Rappler.com","{'ANGRY': 0.45, 'ANNOYED': 0.18, 'HAPPY': 0.09, 'NEUTRAL': 0.09, 'INSPIRED': 0.0, 'AMUSED': 0.0, 'SAD': 0.0, 'AFRAID': 0.0}"

While President Rodrigo Duterte stokes expectations of normalcy 'by December,' experts say even the arrival of a vaccine won't assure this immediately
An infectious disease expert working for the government estimates that the earliest time the Philippines would approve a COVID-19 vaccine for distribution is in the second quarter of 2021 or the months of April to June.
Dr Jaime Montoya, executive director of the Philippine Council for Health Research Development, said this projection takes into consideration the time it will take to conclude crucial Phase 3 trials and the approval process of food and drug administrations.
""My estimate is that it will be available in the Philippines, second quarter of next year,"" he said in a Rappler Talk interview on Friday, September 18.
Dr Melvin Sanicas, a Filipino vaccine expert based in Switzerland, said Montoya's estimate is ""reasonable"" but that it's a ""best-case scenario.""
Montoya's estimated timeline is broken down as follows:
November or December 2020 - Earliest conclusion of Phase 3 trials of any of the 9 most advanced vaccine candidates
January to March 2021 - Food and Drug Administrations (FDA) of the countries where the vaccine candidates are developed approve the vaccine for distribution, based on their assessment of Phase 3 trials.
April to June 2021 - The Philippines' FDA approves a vaccine for local distribution.
This timeline is hinged on many things going right.
The assumption is that Phase 3 trials will run smoothly, which is not always the case. Trials for the vaccine being developed by Oxford University and AstraZeneca, for example, were paused when one of the volunteers experienced an illness. Because the illness turned out to be unrelated to the vaccine, the trials were resumed. But hiccups like this, or even bigger obstacles, can still threaten the progress of Phase 3 trials of all vaccines in the works.
Phase 3 trials are a crucial stage that involves testing thousands of people and comparing results with volunteers given a placebo. This determines if the vaccine is effective in protecting against SARS-CoV-2, and can reveal evidence of other possible side effects that may have been unseen in earlier studies.If a vaccine's Phase 3 trials go well, the results would still have to be assessed by FDAs of its home country and countries that want to distribute the vaccine domestically, like the Philippines.
Montoya said that it's possible for Phase 3 trial data to be submitted to both FDAs simultaneously but this process could lengthen the time it will take for the Philippine FDA to approve the vaccine for distribution. If the home country's FDA were to approve it first, which Montoya estimates could take a month, the Philippines' FDA's assessment would be aided by the approval of the home country's FDA.
Managing expectations set by Duterte
The more realistic expectation of a vaccine approval in the Philippines by the middle of 2021 is in stark contrast to the remarks of President Rodrigo Duterte that Filipinos need only wait until December for a vaccine.""I promise you, by the grace of God, I hope by December we would be back to normal.... Hintayin lang ho ninyo by December kung makatiis kayo (Just wait for December, if you can stand it),"" he said on July 31.
A month later, Duterte claimed that certain vaccines are to be ""distributed worldwide by September, October"" of 2020, again setting expectations.
""When the President said that the vacines are available, he's actually correct. It will be available maybe in their home countriesbut it's unlikely to be available in other countries like the Philippines because, as I said, it will also take time for them to submit their applications to our FDA and for FDA to review it before it can issue an approval for the said vaccine,"" said Montoya.
Duterte has pinned his hopes on 3 China-developed vaccine candidates, Russia's Sputnik V, and the vaccine candidates from US companies Moderna and Pfizer, and UK-Swedish company AstraZeneca.
Consistent with his geopolitical stance, he's given more praise to China and Russia for their assurances that the Philippines would get some level of ""priority"" access to their vaccines.
But he has slammed ""Western"" companies, likely referring to the US and European companies, for supposedly demanding a ""reservation fee"" which Duterte refuses to pay.
Montoya said this fee likely refers to Advance Market Commitment (AMC), which pharmaceutical companies usually ask from governments or other buyers, not just as advance payment but to boost its funding for vaccine development.
Ironically, the Philippines has already agreed to contribute to the AMC being collated by the Gavi COVID-19 Vaccines Global Access (COVAX) Facility. The Duterte administration is ready to cough up P1.5 billion for the program which ensures that the Philippines and other participating countries will get 20% of their needed vaccine supply from a manufacturer.
Upcoming hurdles: Securing supply and distribution
But even with Philippine FDA approval of a vaccine, there's still the challenge of securing a supply of the vaccine, and then distributing it efficiently to Filipinos.
Montoya said that through the COVAX Facility, the Philippines is assured at least of 20% of its vaccine needs, which could mean two doses of a vaccine for around 10 million people. This is if the Philippines' vaccine needs amount to immunization of 60% of its population, the Department of Health threshold for herd immunity.
But the private sector could move independently of the government and secure its own supply of an FDA-approved vaccine. This means that Filipinos who can afford to can buy a vaccine from their doctor even ahead of the free immunization by the government, which would likely cover only health workers and the poorest Filipinos anyway.
Let's say a vaccine does reach a good number of Filipinos. That doesn't mean health measures like mask-wearing and social distancing will be lifted.
The government will have to see the effects of the vaccine and a significant decrease in the number of infected.
""The effect is not immediate. Yes, you have a vaccine. Yes, you may be protected but of course we still have to see first of all, whether you will have the antibodies and whether the antibodies will be sufficiently high enough and if it will last for a long time,"" said Montoya.
Some scientific groups say that a vaccine may have to be administered every year or once every two to 3 years.
Authorities would have to prepare for logistical concerns like ensuring a ""cold chain"" for a vaccine, or ways of transporting a vaccine such that it is kept to a certain low temperature. – Rappler.com","{'SAD': 0.25, 'NEUTRAL': 0.17, 'ANNOYED': 0.17, 'ANGRY': 0.13, 'INSPIRED': 0.0, 'HAPPY': 0.0, 'AMUSED': 0.0, 'AFRAID': 0.0}"

The ADB says the Philippines may opt to increase its vaccine borrowings up to $500 million (P24.05 billion) from the Asia Pacific Vaccine Access Facility
Asian Development Bank (ADB) country director Kelly Bird on Monday, December 21, said the Philippine government asked for $325 million (P15.6 billion) for the purchase and logistical costs of COVID-19 vaccines.
Bird said the Philippines may opt to increase its vaccine borrowings up to $500 million (P24.05 billion) from the Asia Pacific Vaccine Access Facility (APVAX), which has a total allocation of $9 billion for ADB member countries.
The loan terms and interest rate have not been disclosed yet, as the ADB is still coordinating the deal with the Department of Finance and the Department of Health. Bird, however, noted that the loan will be concessional or will have a long grace period and low interest rate.
Bird added that the amount is ""above and beyond"" the $9.4-billion (P452-billion) sovereign lending program for the Philippines, which covers mostly infrastructure projects.
Criteria
The ADB said it will only fund vaccines that have satisfied any of the following criteria:Selected for procurement via COVAX on behalf of participating countriesPrequalified by the World Health Organization
Authorized by a Stringent Regulatory Authority (SRA) for manufacture in an SRA country or the SRA has authorized its manufacture in a non-SRA country
The Philippine government would also submit a national vaccination plan, which safeguards against exclusion of marginalized and vulnerable groups.
The latest developments on the financing that the government is tapping come as it lags in the race to get COVID-19 vaccines.
Indonesia has secured 338 million doses from 5 developers, while Malaysia has secured 14 million doses, most of which would come from Pfizer.
The Philippines' first stockpile of vaccines, 2.6 million doses worth around P700 million, were secured through the efforts of the private sector.
President Rodrigo Duterte and his team struggled to pay in advance for vaccines, supposedly due to the country's strict procurement laws. But even Duterte's officials, particularly his spokesperson Harry Roque, noted that international deals are exempted from such rules.

The scheduled delivery of AstraZeneca vaccines on March 1 'will be delayed for about a week'
Over half a million of vaccine doses from the global COVAX facility will not arrive as expected on Monday, March 1, due to a ""global supply problem,"" according to Health Secretary Francisco Duque III.

It's only in November when task force officials find a way to reserve vaccines without violating the procurement law. Now they're playing catch-up in the global rat race for a vaccine.
The Philippines has joined the global rat race for COVID-19 vaccines, a race fraught with worries about safety and efficacy and limitations of a 3rd world country pitted against the mighty and wealthy.
President Rodrigo Duterte and his delegated pandemic response officials blame procurement laws for the delay in making advance payments critical to securing vaccine doses.
While the United Kingdom, Canada, and United States are snapping up hundreds of millions of doses of Western-developed vaccines and jumpstarting mass vaccinations, the Philippines has, so far, secured only around 3 million doses of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine set to arrive in June 2021 yet.
Even its neighbors in Southeast Asia have managed to secure more doses and are set to begin inoculations much sooner. Indonesia, the only country in the region to surpass the Philippines coronavirus tally, has already received 1.2 million doses of the China-developed CoronaVac (from Sinovac), even if it is yet to secure local regulatory approval.
Indonesia has secured a total of 338 million doses from a variety of vaccine developers – AstraZeneca, US firm Novavax, and China’s SinoVac, CanSino Biologics, and Sinopharm, according to the Duke Global Health Innovation Center’s tracker of global vaccine pre-purchases.
Another neighbor, Malaysia, has secured 14 million doses, 12.8 million of which are to come from Pfizer, whose vaccine is said to be 95% effective.
But though Duterte’s Philippines first signed a deal for a Western vaccine, that of AstraZeneca, officials expect a Chinese or Russian vaccine to arrive on Philippine shores first.
Rappler speaks with various pandemic task force officials to piece together a picture of how the Duterte government is trying to bring a vaccine to the Philippines and why it’s pinned its hopes on China vaccines in particular.
Why China
Duterte’s spokesman Harry Roque phrased it quite bluntly in a press conference on Tuesday, December 15.
“We’re buying from Sinovac because we won’t be able to get vaccines right away from Pfizer, AstraZeneca, or Moderna,” he said in Filipino.
Sinovac is a private Chinese firm that has developed CoronaVac, which has already been administered in China after the country granted it limited use approval in July. However, Sinovac is yet to release efficacy results and its Phase 3 clinical trials in different parts of the world have not yet concluded, as with many other vaccines.
Despite this, CoronaVac is the frontrunner vaccine for the Philippines, with no less than vaccine czar Carlito Galvez Jr saying 25 million doses could arrive in the Philippines in March 2021.
Why the optimism when it comes to Sinovac? It’s because the Chinese company is the most active in engaging with Duterte officials, thanks to the Chinese government.
“They are making commitments and they’re responding positively to us. That’s why Sinovac is one of the most active vaccine suppliers that’s negotiating with our country, because they have the imprimatur of China itself,” said Budget Undersecretary Lloyd Christopher Lao, who is part of the government team in charge of procurement.
At this point, with the urgency of getting Philippine hands on a vaccine, officials will entertain any firm with a promising product.It’s not clear how much government will need to pay China or Sinovac itself. But Lao said “cost is secondary” and that, cost or no cost, Sinovac has, at least, reserved a “huge supply” specifically for Southeast Asian countries, according to Galvez.
Apart from Sinovac and the Russian vaccine, the government expects vaccines of two other Chinese companies, CanSino Biologics and Sinopharm, to be available in the first 3 months of 2021.
But if Foreign Secretary Teodoro Locsin Jr were to be believed, the Philippines' first COVID-19 vaccine would have been US-made.
He claimed a deal for the January 2021 arrival of 10 million Pfizer vaccine doses had been in the works, but was botched by Health Secretary Francisco Duque III. Duque has denied this accusation and provided a timeline of events. The timeline suggests a back-and-forth between government agencies led to the months of delay in signing a confidential disclosure agreement with Pfizer.
MUST READ
Why did the Duterte gov't take months to sign a vaccine deal with Pfizer?
Malacañang still expects the Pfizer vaccine to arrive sometime in the “2nd and 3rd quarter” of 2021.
The struggle to pay in advance
Most pharmaceutical companies ask for an advance payment, termed advance market commitment (AMC), to reserve a supply of their vaccine for a buyer.
This can come in the form of a country investing large amounts of public funds into research and development of that firm’s vaccine.The US did this with its Project Warp Speed, pouring in nearly $500 million into Moderna for vaccine development. As early as July, it also signed a nearly $2 billion deal with Pfizer and German firm BioNTech to secure 100 million doses by end-December. Several countries had also given AMCs even in the early stages of vaccine development, phase 1 and 2 trials.The Philippines did no such thing, and officials, including Duterte, said this was due to limitations imposed by the Government Procurement Act (Republic Act No 9184).
“It's really difficult for us because RA 9184 does not allow us to do advance commitment and only with approval of the President,” said Galvez when asked by Rappler last Monday, December 14.
“We already talked with the COA (Commission on Audit)… So we are the only country that has that difficulty. Other countries, they have a liberal law on procurement. But we are very limited with [RA] 9184,” he added.
The vaccine czar said laws allow the government to give a 15% advance payment whereas pharmaceutical firms and other vaccine supply initiatives required “at least 50%” AMC.But not everyone in the Cabinet took this view. Roque, a lawyer, told the President that international procurement of vaccines is exempted from the procurement law.
“I was one of those that voiced opinion that there is no bar because, number one, there is an exception under the RA 9184 that procurement pursuant to international agreements shall not be covered; and number two, there is express authorization vested on the President under Bayanihan 1 and 2 to resort to extraordinary procurement in relation to COVID,” he said when asked by Rappler.
Justice Secretary Menardo Guevarra, though not asked by Duterte specifically about the legality of advance payments for vaccines, said that in a memo to the President about PhilHealth payments to Red Cross for swab testing, he “pointed out that under auditing rules, advance payments for goods or services not yet delivered are not allowed, unless with prior approval of the President.”
On September 14, in remarks aired on television, Duterte castigated “Western” vaccine companies for asking for advance payments, calling them “crazy” and “all profit” for proposing such an arrangement. He also echoed the thinking that pre-payments for goods that are “non-existent or to-be-produced” violates procurement laws.
Two months later, Duterte reversed his position. On November 19, Roque announced that Duterte had decided to release advance payments to private vaccine developers and secure Advance Market Commitments (AMCs).
PODCAST
[PODCAST] Duterte's vaccine dreams vs reality
The game changer
What led Duterte to change his mind on the critical move of paying in advance for urgently-needed vaccines?
The game changer was Galvez’s discovery of the Asian Development Bank’s new vaccine program for developing countries. The program, Asia Pacific Vaccine Access Facility (APVAX), makes a total of $9 billion available to countries like the Philippines for procuring, transporting, and manufacturing COVID-19 vaccines.
“So what we did, we made a research and we saw that the ADB offers what we call a loan for advance market commitment. And it does not limit us when we sign a contract with a vaccine company. We can elevate it to an international negotiation,” said Galvez in Filipino.
“So with that, when we saw that we can use ADB as a financing strategy, we made a presentation to him (President Duterte) early November and he approved it immediately,” Galvez continued.The ADB funds make vaccine procurement a part of an international agreement, which, according to Roque, is not covered by the strict procurement law. This now gives the government more flexibility in giving advance payments.
It comes at a critical time because Galvez said AMCs have to be secured in December or January. Paying any later would move the Philippines even lower down the line in vaccine orders. For this reason, the over P70 billion for vaccines in the 2021 national budget bill will come too late. Galvez said these funds will instead be used to buy syringes and other equipment needed for mass vaccination and vaccine storage.
Apart from AMCs for private firms, an AMC is also required by the COVAX Facility, an equitable vaccine access initiative that could provide the Philippines with 20% of its vaccine needs from a variety of vaccines that will join the program.
What now?
Apart from locking down reservation fees for vaccines, how early Duterte can get vaccine jabs into Filipino arms will depend on two things: when the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) can authorize use of a vaccine and how fast developers of those vaccines can manufacture doses for the Philippines.
Galvez said the frontrunner for FDA emergency approval is the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine because it's been given emergency approval by the most number of countries.
But in terms of which vaccine developer is most ready to ensure a supply of doses for the Philippines, the frontrunners are Sinovac and Russia’s Gamaleya Institute, creator of the vaccine Sputnik V.
“Sir, if we look at our projection for a potential rollout, if we will be successful with Sinovac and Gamaleya, their initial commitment is, they can supply doses in the first quarter [of 2021],” Galvez told Duterte on Wednesday, December 16.
Sinovac vaccines could arrive in March, Galvez had previously said.
But for this to happen, Galvez and Domingo have made it clear that the Sinovac vaccine and Sputnik V have to pass the safety and efficacy assessments of the government’s vaccine experts panel.
From all negotiations with vaccine makers that Galvez is pursuing, he expects potentially 60 million doses for the Philippines from AstraZeneca, Pfizer, Johnson and Johnson, and Sinovac to arrive in 2021.Image from Presidential Spokesman Harry Roque's December 17, 2020 presentation
But most of these doses have not been secured for the Philippines in terms of signed agreements.
Of the 60 million doses, 10 to 15 million could arrive in the months of May to July next year, at the earliest, said Galvez on Wednesday.
All 8 vaccine sources the government is talking to, including COVAX Facility, Pfizer, and Moderna will only be able to provide doses for the Philippines in the 3rd quarter of 2021 or the months of July to September, at the earliest.
Galvez attributed the relatively long waiting time to the limited production capacity of vaccine manufacturers, given global demand.
Meanwhile, Duterte is acutely aware of the pressing need to show Filipinos that a vaccine is on its way. He knows that 2021, his last full year in power, could be defined by how well his government deploys vaccines to protect people and revive the ailing economy. – Rappler.com","{'ANGRY': 0.51, 'ANNOYED': 0.16, 'SAD': 0.14, 'INSPIRED': 0.0, 'HAPPY': 0.0, 'AMUSED': 0.0, 'NEUTRAL': 0.0, 'AFRAID': 0.0}"

Here are the steps, obligations, and responsibilities local governments will take when procuring and distributing COVID-19 vaccines
Local officials opened 2021 with policy announcements that spelled out their top agenda for the year: securing and distributing COVID-19 vaccines to their communities.From cities hit hardest by the spread of the disease, mayors across the country launched registration sites and allocated millions of pesos to ensure their residents would receive vaccines for free.But except for a few cities that initiated talks with pharmaceutical companies and only involved the national government when negotiations progressed, most local government units (LGUs) were awaiting clear guidance on how they could secure vaccine deals or what their responsibilities would be.
The Duterte government, through vaccine czar Carlito Galvez Jr, had only said LGUs were given the clearance to secure deals with vaccine companies, with the oversight of the national government.
Since the announcement of several LGU-led deals early in January, the Duterte government slowly outlined detailed procedures that local governments could follow when entering into tripartite vaccine deals.Here’s what you need to know.
Tripartite is the format
With limited funds to procure COVID-19 vaccines, the Duterte government has identified tripartite deals as one way the country can increase its orders for vaccines and secure doses for more Filipinos.
The parties involved in tripartite vaccine agreements are the vaccine manufacturers, the national government, and either local government units or the private sector.The first tripartite deal entered into by the national government, in November 2020, involved AstraZeneca and a number of private groups which pooled together nearly P700 million for the purchase of about 2.5 million doses.Before the tripartite agreement with AstraZeneca was signed, the national government had no framework to follow and which it could share with LGUs. The November 2020 agreement served as the basis for similar deals entered into by more private firms and later set the foundation for LGUs’ negotiation with vaccine firms.As more local officials sought clearance to negotiate with pharmaceutical firms, President Rodrigo Duterte finally gave a blanket approval for LGUs to choose their suppliers and enter into tripartite deals.Despite this go signal, not all LGUs will have the funds needed to buy pricey vaccines.
Galvez said the national government would still be responsible for ensuring that second- or third-class municipalities would receive vaccines for their communities, along with prioritizing distribution across the country.MUST READ

The Duterte government's tasks
At the Senate’s recent hearings on vaccines, Galvez detailed a process that interested LGUs could follow when ordering vaccines:LGUs consolidate orders at the provincial or regional level.
The National Task Force (NTF) on COVID-19 processes these orders.NTF, through Galvez, endorses orders to vaccine manufacturers for further negotiations.
According to Undersecretary Epimaco Densing, the Department of the Interior and Local Government (DILG) was considering limiting the number of vaccines an LGU may procure to up to 50% of their population only.
He told lawmakers at the House of Representatives that the cap would be placed to ensure LGUs did not spend all their funds on COVID-19 vaccines as resources were still needed for other pandemic or emergency response measures.Galvez said the national government would take care of supplying the remaining doses for LGUs to ensure herd immunity would be reached in the different localities. Scientists currently estimate about 60% to 70% of a population needs to be vaccinated against COVID-19 to reach herd immunity.
For this subsidy for LGUs, the national government will source doses from those it has secured through direct purchase agreements or from quantities donated by the private sector.MUST READ

What the LGUs need to do
In the case of deals with AstraZeneca – which has so far been the only vaccine company involved in deals – the obligations are the following:LGUs will need to commit a portion of their available budget for the purchase of vaccine doses.LGUs will shoulder a “purchase price” set during negotiations and ensure prompt payment is given following schedules listed in signed agreements.LGUs will need to reimburse AstraZeneca for “all costs associated with delivery, distribution, storage, and destruction” if needed prior to the delivery of vaccines to their final destinations. The reimbursement will include “foreign exchange losses incurred by AstraZeneca” during the term of agreements.LGUs will need to develop a local vaccination plan that is in line with the national government’s distribution and deployment plan.LGUs will need to follow the list of prioritization of vaccines laid out by the national government though the Department of Health (DOH).
LGUs will need to craft COVID-19 vaccine plans that do not compromise the implementation of regular vaccination activities under the National Immunization Program.
Galvez said only AstraZeneca, Moderna, and Novavax so far were willing to enter into tripartite agreements. Discussions on adopting this setup is ongoing with Pfizer, Johnson & Johnson, Gamaleya, and Sinovac.Galvez said all doses ordered by local officials will be transferred to their respective LGUs, unlike deals entered into by the private sector, which required them to donate doses to the national government. In the case of LGUs, the national government will only handle receiving these vaccines from manufacturers once they arrive in the Philippines.MUST READ

The LGU's role in the national government's rollout
Outside of obligations attached to deals, LGUs have a set of responsibilities under the Duterte government’s COVID-19 vaccine distribution plan. They include cold storage preparations, listing of individuals in priority populations, and mapping of vaccination sites.
In a memorandum issued on January 19, the DILG listed specific tasks:
Preparation of information campaigns to encourage vaccinations
Preparation of a master list of priority individuals in compliance with World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines
Identification of possible vaccine centers with cold storage facilities and other logistical equipment
Preparation of a master list of human resources and personnel needed in the vaccination program, like doctors, barangay health workers, and other medical personnel
Attendance of health personnel in vaccination training programs via the DOH website at learn.doh.gov.ph
Reorganization of emergency operations centers to include a dedicated arm for vaccination concerns
Preparation of barangay personnel and volunteers to assist the vaccination program
The DILG said, if LGUs fail to comply, they may face administrative complaints or delays in receiving vaccines from the national government.
Health Secretary Francisco Duque III said the DOH would step in to help provide needed supplies, like syringes, cotton, masks, PPE, and other logistical needs to LGUS. – Rappler.com","{'INSPIRED': 0.31, 'HAPPY': 0.15, 'NEUTRAL': 0.15, 'AMUSED': 0.15, 'ANNOYED': 0.15, 'ANGRY': 0.08, 'SAD': 0.0, 'AFRAID': 0.0}"

(UPDATED) The Philippine General Hospital, Lung Center of the Philippines, East Avenue Medical Center, and Dr Jose N Rodriguez Hospital specifically will receive doses of the Pfizer vaccine
When a COVID-19 vaccine finally arrives in the Philippines, initial doses will be prioritized for health workers working in hospitals treating coronavirus patients.Vaccine czar Carlito Gavlez Jr said hospital workers in high-risk geographical areas would be among the first to be vaccinated against the disease since it was necessary to ensure essential health services continued while the pandemic was still ongoing.“Our hospitals will be first,” Galvez said when asked by Senator Nancy Binay where first doses of a vaccine will go.
Which vaccine will be given?
On February 3, Galvez listed the Philippine General Hospital, Lung Center of the Philippines, East Avenue Medical Center, and Dr Jose N Rodriguez Hospital specifically will receive 117,000 doses of Pfizer and BioNTech’s vaccine supplied by the COVAX facility.
After these hospitals located in Metro Manila – the epicenter of the pandemic in the Philippines – COVID-19 referral hospitals in Cebu City and Davao City will follow.
Another 5 million doses of AstraZeneca’s vaccine are expected to arrive in the first half of 2021.
Considering the status of negotiations and regulatory requirements, Galvez earlier said the first vaccines that could arrive in the Philippines include those being developed by Pfizer and BioNTech, Sinovac, or AstraZeneca.
Among these options, Galvez said Pfizer’s vaccine may be the first to arrive by the end of February through allocations from the GAVI COVAX facility. COVAX officials are currently finalizing a list of low-income countries to be given doses of Pfizer’s vaccine for an early rollout.Galvez said a specific amount of doses to arrive were not yet available as arrangements were still being finalized, though shipments may contain some 50,000 doses for 25,000 health workers.
Unlike other vaccines being eyed by the government, only Pfizer and AstraZeneca have so far secured an emergency use authorization from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).The Pfizer vaccine was the first to be granted emergency approval after the FDA said its review process determined the Pfizer vaccine with an efficacy of 95% met all conditions for an EUA and that that the “benefit of using the vaccine outweighs its known and potential risks.”

As for Sinovac, Galvez said the government signed a term sheet that saw the company commit to supply with country with 25 million doses, though this will be contingent on whether it secured FDA emergency approval.
Without clearance from the FDA, Sinovac cannot be used in the Philippines. The company earlier submitted an application for an EUA, but FDA Director General Eric Domingo said the agency was waiting for phase 3 trial results before moving on to a full review.

Health Secretary Francisco Duque III said the government was preparing ultracold storage facilities needed to keep Pfizer’s vaccines stable once they arrive in the country.Duque said the agency purchased 10 ultralow freezers for this, while officials were also in talks with several logistics and cold storage facilities that have the facilities and extensive experience to handle the vaccine. This included Orca, Royal Cargo, Maersk, LBC, Metro Pacific, and Zuellig Pharma Corporation, among others.
Pfizer officials earlier explained that while doses may last up to 6 months in ultra-low temperature freezers, they can be stored up to 30 days in thermal shippers the company designed, and up to 5 days in normal refrigerated 2-8°C conditions – posing a challenge for the Philippines’ health system. – Rappler.com","{'HAPPY': 0.44, 'AMUSED': 0.31, 'NEUTRAL': 0.13, 'INSPIRED': 0.0, 'ANNOYED': 0.0, 'SAD': 0.0, 'ANGRY': 0.0, 'AFRAID': 0.0}"

The Philippines has relaxed a ban on deploying its healthcare workers overseas, but still limits the number of medical professionals leaving the country to 5,000 a year
The Philippines will let thousands of its healthcare workers, mostly nurses, take up jobs in Britain and Germany if the two countries agree to donate much-needed coronavirus vaccines, a senior official said on Tuesday, February 23.
The Philippines, which has among Asia's highest number of coronavirus cases, has relaxed a ban on deploying its healthcare workers overseas, but still limits the number of medical professionals leaving the country to 5,000 a year.
Alice Visperas, director of the labor ministry's international affairs bureau, said the Philippines was open to lifting the cap in exchange for vaccines from Britain and Germany, which it would use to inoculate outbound workers and hundreds of thousands of Filipino repatriates.
Nurses are among the millions of Filipinos who work overseas, providing in excess of $30 billion a year in remittances vital to the country's economy.
""We are considering the request to lift the deployment cap, subject to agreement,"" Visperas told Reuters.
Britain is grappling with the world's sixth-highest coronavirus death toll and one of the worst economic hits from the pandemic, while Germany has the 10th most infections globally.
While the two countries have inoculated a combined 23 million people, the Philippines has yet to start its campaign to immunize 70 million adults, or two-thirds of its 108 million people. It expects to receive its first batch of vaccines this week, donated by China.
The Philippines wants to secure 148 million doses of vaccines altogether.
The British embassy in Manila did not immediately respond to a request for comment, while calls to Germany's mission went unanswered.
In 2019, almost 17,000 Filipino nurses signed overseas work contracts, government data showed.
While Filipino nurses have fought to lift the deployment ban to escape poor working conditions and low pay at home, the workers-for-vaccine plan has not gone down well with some medical workers.

Philippine Foreign Secretary Teodoro Locsin Jr also says there is 'no need' for the setup since the United Kingdom pledged vaccines 'without any expectation of return'
The United Kingdom (UK) declined to take up the Philippines on its offer to let more health workers leave the country if it agreed to donate coronavirus vaccines for Filipinos.Reuters reported on Wednesday, February 24, that a British health ministry spokesperson said the country had ""no plans"" to agree to such a deal, and that the UK instead planned to donate surplus vaccine doses to other countries in the future.""We have confirmed that we will share any surplus vaccines in the future – for example through the COVAX international procurement pool,"" the spokesperson said.British Ambassador to the Philippines Daniel Pruce echoed the statement on Wednesday, saying the country had ""no plans"" to link access to vaccines and Filipino healthcare professionals working in the UK.The Philippines' Department of Labor and Employment (DOLE) earlier broached the subject of lifting a current cap on the deployment of health workers in exchange for COVID-19 vaccines from the UK and Germany. The proposal drew wide criticism from nurses groups and lawmakers in the Philippines who hit the labor department for ""dangling"" Filipino workers in exchange for access to the coveted good.In a press conference on Wednesday, DOLE spokesperson Rolly Francia denied the agency was trading workers for vaccines.
Francia said the DOLE wanted to highlight that if more healthcare workers would be deployed beyond the cap, host countries should vaccinate them for their own protection. He added no details or specifics were also discussed over whether the nurses-for-vaccines was a ""hard negotiation.""
In a series of tweets, Foreign Secretary Teodoro Locsin Jr said there was ""no need"" for such an arrangement as the UK earlier pledged to help the Philippines secure doses of a vaccine developed by British drugmaker AstraZeneca.""No need. Ambassador Pruce got us AstraZeneca without any expectation of return,"" Locsin said.Nearly 20,000 Filipinos make up the staff of the NHS, UK's healthcare system, ranking as the third largest group of foreign health workers in the country following British and Indian staff.Filipino nurses have been recognized worldwide for their contribution to foreign health systems across Europe, the Middle East, and North America, among others.

The Healthcare Professionals Alliance Against COVID-19 warns that allowing for such a setup could severely impact public health safety and lead to the inequitable rollout of vaccines in the Philippines
Several of the Philippines' top health experts on Thursday, February 11, opposed lawmakers' efforts to push for bills that would allow local government units (LGUs) to buy coronavirus vaccines directly from manufacturers.
The Healthcare Professionals Alliance Against COVID-19 (HPAAC) – the largest coalition of health groups in the country – warned that proposed measures seeking to grant LGUs this authority could severely impact the public health safety and rollout of vaccines in the country.It could also create unequal access to limited shots throughout the country, with prioritization of the coveted good defined by access to funds and the capacity to pay, instead of need based on exposure and risk to COVID-19.""This is not about money but justice – social justice,"" said Dr Aileen Espina, a public health and family medicine specialist, during a press conference on Thursday night.
Internal medicine specialist and epidemiologist Dr Antonio Dans, along with Dr Inday Dans, pediatrician and clinical epidemiologist, said the group was strongly opposed to the possible passage of Senate Bill No. 2042 filed by Senate Majority Leader Miguel Zubiri last February 8.
Dans appealed to lawmakers and Zubiri to reconsider the bill, saying it would impact the public's trust in the government's COVID-19 vaccination program.""This will impact public trust greatly, not just when it comes to effectiveness of vaccines but in their trust that no one will be left behind, people will be treated equally, and the country will move forward together,"" Dans said in Filipino.While the group focused on SB 2042, similar measures had been filed at the House of Representatives by Speaker Lord Allan Velasco, House Majority Leader Martin Romualdez, House Minority Leader Stephen Paduano, as well as Quirino Representative Junie Cua.
The bigger picture
Lawmakers in both the House and the Senate have been pushing for measures that would allow LGUs and the private sector to buy vaccines directly from manufacturers, without the oversight of national government.
They argued that allowing for such purchase schemes would speed up access to vaccines in the country. This comes after they criticized the national government's supposed ""monopoly"" over purchase deals that hampered Filipinos' access to COVID-19 shots.
But health experts opposed such measures for 3 main reasons:First, that it would bypass the required recommendation of the Health Technology Assessment Council (HTAC), which is mandated to review medical technology eyed for use in a public health program. The HTAC, created by the Universal Health Care Law, reviews the feasibility and cost-efficiency of health technology like vaccines for public use, as well as potential commercial or political conflicts of interest.
Second, it would lead to ""maldistribution"" of vaccines, where richer LGUs with the capacity to pay would get priority access to already limited vaccines, leaving poorer communities further behind.Third, patchwork purchasing of vaccines, as opposed to centralized purchase through the national government, would escalate vaccine prices ""because the country will lose the scale or volume that one buyer has.""
Dans said the HTAC's recommendation guaranteed public safety of vaccines as the group of independent scientists continuously reviewed vaccines to balance ""benefit, harm, and cost” that may shift quickly, ""even overnight,"" as more information on COVID-19 and vaccines were shared.
This recommendation is separate from the Food and Drug Administration's issuance of emergency approval, which focused only on the safety and efficacy of a vaccine.""Bypassing recommendations of this council will expose the people to the dangers of inappropriate technology, and may make local policy makers liable for wrong decisions,"" he said.Allowing LGUs to purchase vaccines on their own would also hamper goals of a vaccine program to reduce mortality and maintain healthcare capacity. They stressed that since supplies worldwide are limited, scarce shots should be given to those who need it most across the country: healthcare workers, elderly, and people with comorbidities.
Dans said: ""If there was no lack of vaccines, it would be acceptable, but with limited supplies, the scarce vaccines should be give to those who need it the most.... One problem of the pandemic is the poor are always shortchanged.""

As vaccine arrival nears, health experts ask Filipinos to ‘respect’ priority list
Granting LGUs the authority to buy vaccines on their own could also threaten proper allocation of funds, as the HPAAC pointed out that nearly half of the cost of immunization programs is spent on actually implementing the rollout of vaccines.
With doses already severely limited worldwide and developed countries having access to majority of vaccines produced, the HPAAC said allowing LGUs to purchase vaccines directly from manufacturers may see the same scenario of unequal distribution take place locally.""We aggravate this inequity by doing the same thing locally – distributing geographically according to capacity to pay. When this happens, we all suffer, not just those whom we push to the end of the queue,"" the group said.Dans said the group had presented its position to lawmakers at the Senate, but that discussions indicated preference for the bill to be passed despite its possible negative impact on the country's COVID-19 vaccination program.What works now
The HPAAC appealed to lawmakers to keep the current scheme where LGUs and the private sector buy vaccines along with the national government, since this would assure equal distribution and continuous safety.This setup would also comply with the FDA's conditions for use under an emergency use authorization (EUA), which allows for its public use under strict conditions.
While the proposed bills in Congress mentioned LGUs could only buy vaccines that have been granted an EUA by the FDA, the HPAAC pointed out that an EUA was still different from securing full marketing authority necessary to commercialize the vaccine and allow its sale in the market.Current purchase schemes involving LGUs and the private sector take the form of tripartite deals where the national government, through the National Task Force against COVID-19, signs deals with vaccine manufacturers and either LGUs or business groups.Vaccine czar Carlito Galvez Jr had told lawmakers during previous congressional hearings that this allowed for LGUs and the private sector to take part in vaccine procurement – something unique to the Philippines, as vaccine manufacturers have so far preferred to deal directly with national governments only.According to Galvez, tripartite deals allow the Philippines to meet this condition of vaccine companies which they observed with all countries, especially as supplies of vaccines remain severely limited.
Galvez had also earlier told senators that allowing LGUs and private groups to directly buy COVID-19 vaccines was not yet possible. This was because ""no company"" would engage in deals that did not involve national governments of other countries, which have only been granting emergency use approvals to COVID-19 vaccines. – Rappler.com","{'ANNOYED': 0.2, 'HAPPY': 0.14, 'ANGRY': 0.14, 'AMUSED': 0.14, 'SAD': 0.11, 'INSPIRED': 0.0, 'NEUTRAL': 0.0, 'AFRAID': 0.0}"

Vergeire gave the assurance during a virtual press briefing, when she was asked whether the absence of local clinical trials of Moderna's COVID-19 vaccine would have any implication on the government's vaccine procurement plan.
""Although, of course, that is the ideal.

She added that if the country's vaccine expert panel would be able to evaluate the vaccine and gets the Food and Drug Administration approval, ""then we can readily procure these sets of vaccines.""
Moderna announced on Monday that its experimental vaccine against COVID-19 was almost 95% effective, marking a second major breakthrough in the quest to end the pandemic.

President Rodrigo Duterte's approval is needed since Philippine auditing and procurement laws prohibit making advance payments
President Rodrigo Duterte has approved the Philippine government’s prepayment for Pfizer’s COVID-19 vaccine, paving the way for the country’s access to the medicine expected to provide protection against the virus.Health Undersecretary Maria Rosario Vergeire announced this in a press briefing on Monday, November 23, saying, “Yes, I want to confirm that the President has already approved this prepayment.”
Vergeire added the final price for vaccines could not be disclosed until the deal was final since the government signed a confidentiality agreement with the company.
Duterte’s approval for the purchase is needed as Philippine auditing and procurement laws prohibit making advance payments for services and supplies not delivered yet.
Why this matters
The country’s pandemic officials earlier sought Duterte’s approval for advance payments for COVID-19 vaccines, which were necessary to secure supplies of doses once a viable vaccine becomes available.Unlike most other countries, the Philippines has been constrained in securing supplies for a vaccine as it could not easily make the necessary payment as commitment.Duterte’s special approval will be complemented by arrangements with the Asian Development Bank and other financing institutions, as well as big business groups that expressed willingness to handle advanced payments for the Philippines.Supplies ensured
Philippine Ambassador to the United States Jose Manuel ""Babe"" Romualdez earlier said Pfizer was ready to supply the Philippines with doses of its vaccine once it was approved by local regulatory authorities.Still, most of the companies’ supplies produced this year will likely be given to the United States, which ordered 100 million doses of the vaccine for $1.95 billion.

The shortfall comes despite President Rodrigo Duterte's repeated claims that a vaccine is the 'only salvation' from the pandemic
As experts around the world race to find an effective COVID-19 vaccine, the Philippines' Department of Health (DOH) said it lacked some P10 billion needed to procure enough doses for the identified priority groups.
At the DOH’s regular press briefing on Monday, October 19, Health Undersecretary Maria Rosario Vergeire said that the initial P2.5 billion allocated for vaccines in the proposed 2021 budget would not cover procurement needed to vaccinate an initial target of 20% of the Philippines’ population.Citing estimated costs computed by the agency, Vergeire said the DOH would need roughly P12.1 billion to purchase doses needed to inoculate priority populations which include health workers and indigent Filipinos.
Vergeire said the amount was based on prospective prices for potential vaccines being marketed, most of which may require two doses.“It totaled to P12.1 billion so we lack about P10 billion in that budget,” Vergeire told reporters in a mix of English and Filipino.Vergeire had made the statement after referring to the lack of funds raised by Marikina City 2nd District Representative Stella Quimbo. She earlier expressed dismay over the P2.5 billion allocation, warning it would cover only 3.9 million of the targeted 20 million to be vaccinated.Why does this matter?
The lack of funds needed to procure enough doses of a COVID-19 vaccine highlights the skewed priorities of the government’s pandemic recovery budget.While the country continues to record an increase in cases, the government has earmarked only some P90 billion for coronavirus efforts out of the proposed P4.5 trillion of the 2021 budget.The DOH’s shortfall of about P10 billion also comes as President Rodrigo Duterte has repeatedly touted a COVID-19 vaccine as the “only salvation” from the pandemic.MUST READ

Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Director General Eric Domingo announced on Friday, October 30, that Chinese company Clover Biopharmaceuticals has applied to conduct clinical trials for the coronavirus vaccine in the country.
(Editor's note: An earlier version of this report referred to Clover Biopharmaceuticals as an Australian company. This has been corrected.)
In a virtual press briefing on Friday morning, Domingo said that Clover has submitted its clinical trials data to the vaccine expert panel (VEP) for evaluation.
Domingo said he could not give more details about Clover as he only knew about its intent on Friday.
To date, at at least 3 companies expressed interest in conducting Phase 3 clinical trials in the Philippines. Under such trials, a vaccine is given to hundreds of people split into different age groups.
Aside from Clover, health officials cited China’s Sinovac and Russia’s Sputnik V among candidate vaccines that could possibly see independent trials in the country.For Russia’s COVID-19 vaccine, the VEP is still evaluating data from phases 1 and 2 of its clinical trials. According to the New York Times’ vaccine tracker, this vaccine is a ""combination of two adenoviruses, Ad5 and Ad26, both engineered with a coronavirus gene.""
As for Sinovac, the VEP has endorsed this to the FDA. Domingo said the agency is anticipating the submission of its application for Phase 3 trials after it gets the endorsement of the ethics board.Clinical trials are a type of research that evaluates potential medical interventions that affect one's health.

The government has identified 35 million Filipinos who will be given the first batch of COVID-19 vaccine doses
Once a COVID-19 vaccine is approved by Philippine authorities, the government aims to vaccinate around 60 million to 70 million of its citizens in 3 to 5 years, said the country's vaccine czar Carlito Galvez Jr.
""More or less 60 to 70 million [people], we will do this in a 3- to 5-year period,"" he said in a virtual press briefing on Wednesday, November 25.
This number of people corresponds to roughly 60% to 70% of the country's 107 million population.
The government is capable of vaccinating only 20 million to 30 million Filipinos a year, he added.
Going by the government's ""best case scenario"" estimate that a vaccine will become locally available by April to June 2021, it would mean that 60% of the population should have been vaccinated by 2024 to 2026.
But Galvez's ""worst case scenario,"" which he also termed as the ""realistic scenario,"" is that the government's vaccine distribution will start late 2021 or early 2022.
35 million Filipinos in 'priority list'
With this schedule in mind, the coronavirus national task force has already come up with a list of 35 million people who will get the vaccine first.
""We have a list of more than 35 million Filipinos who are in the priority list. That was given by the DOH (Department of Health), based on the guidance of our President,"" said Galvez.
The list includes healthcare workers, frontliners like police, soldiers, and essential workers of the social welfare and education departments, poor households, and indigents, he added.
President Rodrigo Duterte previously said he wanted to foot the bill of COVID-19 vaccination for all Filipinos. But Finance Secretary Carlos Dominguez III only announced a funding target of P73.2 billion to inoculate 60 million people.
Preparations for cold storage
Galvez said the task force is negotiating with a consortium of companies that can provide ultra cold storage facilities required to distribute some vaccines, like those being developed by Pfizer and Moderna.
The next 6 months, he said, would be spent preparing the logistics of this equipment, as well as storage facilities for vaccines that would need only 2 or 8 degrees Celsius to keep.
What the task force is busy with is ensuring that there is adequate funding for vaccination logistics.
Galvez said the task force is asking lawmakers to include P150 billion for logistics and distribution in the 2021 national budget, which is now being threshed out in the Senate. This P150 billion amount was first proposed by Senate President Pro Tempore Ralph Recto.
""We spoke with Congress and the Senate. It should be included there because the P2.5 billion initial [fund] is just for an initial 3 million vaccines for essential health workers,"" said the vaccine czar.
The Philippine Food and Drug Administration is now waiting for countries like the United States, China, and India to approve the vaccines being developed by their firms. Only then can the FDA also issue emergency use approval, as ordered by Duterte.
While the government is securing supply for priority sectors of the population, private companies are also moving to secure doses for their employees. It's likely that Filipinos willing to pay for vaccination could get inoculated even before the government's vaccination efforts reach them. – Rappler.com","{'ANGRY': 0.24, 'SAD': 0.21, 'ANNOYED': 0.14, 'INSPIRED': 0.0, 'HAPPY': 0.0, 'AMUSED': 0.0, 'NEUTRAL': 0.0, 'AFRAID': 0.0}"

After the rollout of the national COVID-19 vaccination program in Metro Manila, Cebu will begin inoculating residents in the city and province starting on Wednesday, March 3.The program will begin with health workers at the Vicente Sotto Memorial Medical Center, Cebu City's largest public hospital.
The Department of Health Central Visayas (DOH-7) said 2,900 employees would be eligible to get the vaccine, although some employees are hesitant to get Sinovac – the only vaccine in the country at the moment – due to concerns over its efficacy rate.The national government earlier said health workers could wait for the AstraZeneca vaccine, slated to arrive in the Philippines in the second week of March.Cebu City is among the 3 priority areas named by the national government for its vaccination program, along with Metro Manila and Davao.MUST READ

According to an initial survey by the DOH-7, 5,634,789 people are eligible for vaccinations in the Central Visayas region in 2021. The health department hopes to vaccinate at least 70% of the population or more by the end of the year, and the other 30% in 2022.Central Visayas is home to about 7 million people and includes Metro Cebu, the second biggest metropolitan area outside of Metro Manila.
According to Mel Feliciano, the Inter Agency Task Force (IATF) for COVID-19's chief implementer in the Visayas, Cebu City had already submitted its priority list to the task force.
""We will finalize the vaccination program of [Cebu City], and it can just be replicated to municipalities and other cities,"" Feliciano said.
Although the first city outside Metro Manila to receive vaccines, Cebu City remains among big cities in the Visayas that do not have a tripartite deal with other brands.
Smaller cities like Ormoc, Bacolod, and Iloilo all have signed agreements for AstraZeneca, aside from the vaccines allocated by the national government.

Mayors get resourceful to lock in vaccine doses at a time when the national government scrambles to finalize deals for the country as a whole
Back-to-back announcements by cities in the Philippines about agreements inked with developers of COVID-19 vaccines have brought a glimmer of hope to many Filipinos weary of the pandemic.
Finally, there was something somewhat solid for Filipinos amid enviable news from other countries, where health workers and the elderly are already getting the sought-after jabs.
Many could not help but compare the speed by which cities signed deals with British-Swedish pharmaceutical firm AstraZeneca against the fact that the national government itself had yet to enter into any agreement. (LIST: Local governments' plans for COVID-19 vaccines)
""Many local government units opted to go on their own. They buy, because they have the money, and they chose their own vaccine,"" acknowledged President Rodrigo Duterte on Wednesday, January 13.
Before cities began signing their vaccine deals, the only other signed agreement to secure doses was initiated and financially backed by private corporations like Udenna Corporation, Aboitiz Foundation, BDO Foundation, and others.Though all these agreements could not have been signed without the participation of the national government, it was the efforts of mayors and corporate executives that catalyzed and quickly shepherded the process.
How did the mayors of several cities in Metro Manila and across the country secure these agreements? What can other mayors or governors learn from their experience?
Rappler reporters spoke with the following local officials to find out:
Mayor Rex Gatchalian of Valenzuela City
Mayor Francis Zamora of San Juan City
Mayor Joy Belmonte of Quezon City and Joseph Juico, co-chairperson of Quezon City's vaccine task force
Mayor Sara Duterte of Davao City
How their efforts began
Deals were finalized and signed in early January, but most mayors began initial efforts to scout for a vaccine supplier months before.
Mayor Duterte said she began sending unsolicited letters to various vaccine makers in October 2020.
Around this time, Quezon City had also begun scouting around, according to Juico. By late November, Quezon City had begun talks with vaccine developers and had asked national government agencies on how they could proceed, Mayor Belmonte said.
In these months, mayors were walking blind, with the national government not having cascaded any clear plan on coordination for vaccine procurement.
It was only in early November when vaccine czar Carlito Galvez Jr publicly presented an initial National Vaccine Roadmap, where the only mentioned involvement of the local governments would be in identifying recipients, distributing vaccines, and rolling out information campaigns.
But, by the end of that month, private firms managed to ink a deal with AstraZeneca for 3 million doses. The national government was part of the deal since AstraZeneca had told corporation executives it needed the government involved.It was also in November when firms like Pfizer, AstraZeneca, Moderna, and Russia’s Gamaleya Institute began announcing efficacy rates from Phase III trials of their vaccines, creating excitement and then clamor from the public. A 70% efficacy rating was found for AstraZeneca’s vaccine in a study published on December 8.
So, without the national government’s hand, mayors moved independently to contact vaccine makers. Belmonte got a number of an AstraZeneca executive from private doctors. Mayor Duterte, in an October meeting with the British embassy on another matter, discussed vaccines and was told to write to AstraZeneca for access, a suggestion she took.
Duterte had also asked officials at the Chinese consulate in Davao City “for options,” which led them to put her in touch with Sinovac. In the same way, a United States embassy official sent her an email, asking if they could help the city, and she responded. The embassy then endorsed a meeting with US firm Johnson & Johnson, whose pharmaceutical company, Janssen, is slated to conduct vaccine clinical trials in the Philippines.
Matters speed up in January
As of late November and early December, mayors like Belmonte and Valenzuela’s Gatchalian had still been hesitant to sign anything solid or make any orders with vaccine firms.
For Belmonte, this was because they didn’t think it wise to finalize an order without the guidance of the Food and Drug Administration, the agency that would identify which vaccines could be administered and distributed in the country.
San Juan’s Zamora said he also wanted to keep their options open for the possibility of sourcing vaccines from other providers. He said he did not want to “over-order” either, as they anticipated the national government to allocate vaccines for them.
It was in early December when Galvez had meetings with Metro Manila mayors where he explained the national government’s vaccine plans.
According to Zamora, Galvez had given local government units (LGUs) the go signal to procure vaccines on their own as long as mayors would coordinate with the national government.
But, in Davao City, Mayor Sara, the President’s daughter, had not yet heard of any vaccine coordination plan from the national government.
On December 10, she said the national government should let LGUs access vaccine deals on their own.
“In my opinion, if they allow LGUs to move on their own to access vaccines approved by the national government, then the LGUs may be able to help the national government move the vaccines to a large segment of the population,” she said over Davao City Disaster Radio.

It was on December 15 when Quezon City was able to get in touch with AstraZeneca officials. The firm sent them the next day a non-disclosure agreement (NDA), which was reviewed by the city’s legal department then sent back to AstraZeneca on December 17, said Juico.
A few days before Christmas, December 22, city hall and AstraZeneca officials sat down for a meeting to discuss the vaccine.
After a lull due to the holidays, the United Kingdom regulatory agency (Medicine and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency) announced its emergency use approval for AstraZeneca’s vaccine on December 30.
When Juico called up AstraZeneca after the news, he was told things would have to move faster.
“That’s when they said we have to move quickly because it’s approved by the UK and they need to talk with Mayor because a certain number of doses is available for allocation for QC,” Juico said.
Belmonte swung into action, calling up Galvez on January 1 to get clearance from the national government.
“Secretary Galvez acted quickly. On the same day, he texted the parameters and then called Mayor to say the President has already agreed that LGUs can enter into tripartite agreements as long as national government takes the lead,” said Juico.
Valenzuela City and San Juan City had a similar experience, though they had reached out to AstraZeneca weeks after Quezon City.
From a wait-and-see stance in early December, things moved quickly once the cities had contacted AstraZeneca on the first week of January. The entire process, from first contact to signing of an agreement, took just one week, according to Zamora and Gatchalian.
What Gatchalian found helpful was how efficient AstraZeneca was, the guidance from the Metropolitan Manila Development Authority, and the framework provided by the tripartite agreement.
Another reason why deals with AstraZeneca pushed through faster than the rest was because the firm had agreed to the tripartite agreement model with national government.
This type of agreement has proven crucial to locking in vaccine doses because it entails an assurance of payment and orders that the national government has been hesitant to make due to procurement laws.
For LGUs, engaging in a tripartite agreement also assures them that the deals they are signing comply with the national government’s guidelines, which have not been clear.
Presidential Spokesman Harry Roque had said this about the first such tripartite deal, the one with private corporations. He said it was one way to reserve vaccines without fear of violating procurement regulations since it was another entity promising to pay for the supply.
The other work-around devised by Galvez was to use funding from the Asian Development Bank for advance orders since procurement laws don’t cover international aid. But for this funding to be released, the ADB requires that the vaccine to be procured must have approval from a mature regulatory agency.
What local governments commit to do in vaccine deals
According to the tripartite agreements, the local governments will take charge of the vaccines they order – from payment to administering doses to their citizens.
“They will buy, they will pay, they will pay for all the expenses, including delivery of vaccines, and they will also vaccinate their constituents in accordance with the National Vaccination Plan,” said Roque in a press briefing on Tuesday, January 12.
Roque had bared provisions in the agreements entered into by cities, AstraZeneca, and the national government during the briefing. One of these provisions says payments of local governments need not pass through the national government, but will go straight to AstraZeneca.
Local governments are also in charge of paying for and coordinating the delivery of the vaccines to their areas.
This level of involvement of local governments was nowhere to be found in Galvez’s initial November 3 vaccine plan.
It was later on, absent more concrete moves from the national government, when mayors “offered” this level of involvement.
“It was the LGUs who offered their help to the NTF (National Task Force), the national government, to buy vaccines for their constituents,” said Roque.
In meetings with Metro Manila mayors, Galvez had expressed gratitude to the local chiefs for their initiative.
How about LGUs without resources to secure vaccine doses?
The mayors of Metro Manila and other highly-urbanized cities like Davao City, Bacolod City, and Antipolo City have big budgets. Davao City is even led by the President’s daughter. But what of smaller or less influential cities or provinces?
Malacañang has given assurances that they won’t be left behind.
“No! Because the national government, the NTF, is prepared to buy for everyone,” said Roque in Filipino.
Finally, on Monday, January 11, the national government signed an agreement with US firm Novavax for 30 million doses of its vaccine. Soon after, it also signed a deal with China’s Sinovac for 25 million doses.
Yet all these agreements – whether signed by the national government, cities, or private firms – are hinged on the all-important emergency use approval by the FDA. Without this approval, the agreements can’t be implemented. So far, only the Pfizer vaccine has been granted emergency use approval.
In the coming months, all eyes will be on how well the Duterte administration coordinates with mayors and governors to ensure an efficient and equitable vaccine roll-out. – with reports from Rambo Talabong and Jodesz Gavilan/Rappler.com","{'HAPPY': 0.36, 'INSPIRED': 0.19, 'AMUSED': 0.18, 'NEUTRAL': 0.0, 'ANNOYED': 0.0, 'SAD': 0.0, 'ANGRY': 0.0, 'AFRAID': 0.0}"

Finance Secretary Carlos Dominguez III says the government and private sector are in negotiations for 178 million doses for Filipinos
The Philippines is preparing to order enough coronavirus vaccines for 92 million doses, 20 million more than its vaccination program target, in anticipation of delays and other complications, said Finance Secretary Carlos Dominguez III.
He gave this figure in a report to President Rodrigo Duterte on Monday, February 1, at the Malacañang Golf Clubhouse during a meeting with other Cabinet members.
""We have negotiated for 92 million because we read in the newspapers about slippage, delays in delivery. There's delays in Europe, there's delays in the US, so to be safe we are negotiating more than what we need of 70 million,"" said Dominguez.
""We really expect delays but delay is not our fault because we have the money and we are ready, the delay is in the manufacturing,"" he continued.
The government and private sector are already in negotiations to bring the Philippines' total vaccine orders to 178 million doses, said Dominguez. Since most COVID-19 vaccines come in two doses, these would be enough for 89 million Filipinos.
Funding for vaccines
As it stands, the country has locked in some 146 million doses of vaccines – 40 million from the World Health Organization-led COVAX Facility and some 106 million to 108 million from direct arrangements with various pharmaceutical firms.
Dominguez said the deals with firms will be paid for using loans from the World Bank, Asian Development Bank, and Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, cumulatively worth $1.2 billion.
Meanwhile, the Philippines paid $84 million to participate in the COVAX scheme, said Dominguez.
The 146 million doses would be enough to vaccinate all Filipino adults, which the finance chief said number around 70 million. The remaining 40 million in the country's population are one to 18 year-olds who may not be allowed to get vaccine shots for safety reasons. – Rappler.com","{'ANNOYED': 0.21, 'INSPIRED': 0.21, 'HAPPY': 0.21, 'NEUTRAL': 0.17, 'AMUSED': 0.13, 'SAD': 0.0, 'ANGRY': 0.0, 'AFRAID': 0.0}"

“They did.

Why this matters
AstraZeneca’s filing is timely and strategic considering the company is the only firm to sign solid tripartite agreements with the national government, local government units, and private sector in the Philippines.This includes a purchase deal closed by the private sector and national government for 2.6 million doses, as well as a separate deal signed by Quezon City for 750,000 doses.Apart from this, Presidential Adviser for Entrepreneurship and Go Negosyo founder Joey Concepcion earlier said negotiations for a second batch were underway as over 200 companies “and counting” pledged to purchase and expressed their interest in the vaccine.
Vaccine performance
The company’s vaccine is among those at the forefront of vaccine development.Early analysis of clinical trial results showed an average efficacy of about 70%. On the higher end, the vaccine was seen to be 90% effective in participants who were given a half dose, followed by a full dose. This was compared to 62% efficacy seen in participants who were given two full doses.Its vaccine can be transported and handled ""at normal refrigerated conditions"" of between 2 to 8 degrees Celsius (36 to 46 degrees Fahrenheit) for at least 6 months, making it compatible with the Department of Health (DOH) storage facilities. – Rappler.com","{'HAPPY': 0.56, 'NEUTRAL': 0.27, 'INSPIRED': 0.09, 'AMUSED': 0.0, 'ANNOYED': 0.0, 'SAD': 0.0, 'ANGRY': 0.0, 'AFRAID': 0.0}"

'Requirements and standard agreements are common to all countries. They're not specific to the Philippines, and they are not related to...Dengvaxia,' says WHO Philippines Representative Rabindra Abeyasinghe.
World Health Organization (WHO) Philippines Representative Rabindra Abeyasinghe denied the Philippines was being asked for specific requirements in its indemnification agreement with vaccine firm Pfizer due to the Dengvaxia dengue controversy.This is contrary to claims made by vaccine czar Carlito Galvez Jr who earlier said that arrest warrants issued in relation to the Dengvaxia scandal in the Philippines impacted the government’s negotiation efforts with manufacturers.Galvez attributed the delay in vaccine procurement to the Dengvaxia issue. He told reporters, “The situation changed. We have to understand. What happened with the warrants of arrest for Sanofi, it has great implications on our procurement, really.” He added that the arrest warrants announced last February 1 “changed everything.”But In a virtual briefing on Tuesday, February 23, Abeyasinghe clarified the Philippines was instead asked to sign onto a “standard” indemnification agreement similar to those presented to different countries receiving the COVID-19 vaccine developed by Pfizer and BioNTech.“Let me clarify that the requirements and standard agreements are common to all countries. They're not specific to the Philippines, and they are not related to any issue that happened in the country relating to Dengvaxia or anything else,” he said when asked if the Philippines was being asked for special indemnity requirements.
Abeyasinghe made the statement after the rollout of the Philippines’ COVID-19 vaccination had been delayed due to paperwork on indemnification agreements required by manufacturers as vaccines are still under emergency use authorization worldwide.The Philippines earlier targeted to start its vaccination campaign by February 2021, with initial doses of Pfizer and AstraZeneca’s COVID-19 vaccine supplied by the WHO’s COVAX facility.What's the status of delivery now?
Abeyasinghe said the issues raised between Pfizer and the Philippine government included the need for an indemnification law in the Philippines as well as “several minor clauses” in a letter detailing indemnification requirements.Philippine lawmakers were seeking to address the need for legislation on indemnification with the passage of bills creating an indemnification fund for adverse events following immunization. The House of Representatives passed its version of the measure on Monday, February 23, while the Senate passed a counterpart bill on Tuesday.As to requirements listed in a letter between the Philippines and Pfizer, the WHO said Philippine officials received documents on these details Tuesday morning.“So maybe today or tomorrow we will see a resolution of that impasse and maybe there'll be room to hear about when potential vaccine deliveries can happen,” Abeyasinghe said.As for initial AstraZeneca doses coming from the COVAX facility, Abeyasinghe said the Department of Health had supplied “all letters necessary” to access supplies part of an early rollout of the vaccine. AstraZeneca, he added, did not require a further exchange of letters on the indemnification requirement.Abeyasinghe said the WHO remained optimistic it would pin down an initial date of AstraZeneca’s COVID-19 vaccine for the Philippines this week with doses to be sourced from those manufactured in South Korea.Both Pfizer and AstraZeneca have secured emergency use authorization from the Food and Drug Administration with first doses to be given to frontline health workers in 32 hospitals across Manila, along with two more in Cebu City and Davao City.As more countries across the region started the rollout of COVID-19 vaccines among their populations, health workers and local officials tasked with distributing vaccines said they were ready to start vaccinating people by the government’s targeted February rollout.

FDA Director General Eric Domingo says the agency is waiting for lacking documents before it could move on with further reviews
The Food and Drug Adminisitration on Friday, January 8, said it has received an application for emergency use authorization of Russia’s Sputnik V vaccine developed by the Gamaleya Research Institute.
In an official statement, the FDA said it received the application for an emergency use authorization (EUA) on Thursday, January 7, one day after the firm expressed interest to secure one.
FDA Director General Eric Domingo said the submission had been pre-assessed and that its applicant was “instructed to comply with lacking documents.”
Domingo told Rappler that the 21-day period to review Gamaleya's EUA application will not start until it submits all necessary documentary requirements.
Gamaleya earlier eyed Phase 3 clinical trials in the Philippines, and sent a partial submission for these efforts last December 17.
Earlier on Friday, Department of Science and Technology Undersecretary for Rowena Guevara said Gamaleya informed the Philippines’ vaccine expert panel last January 6, that it would no longer pursue trials and instead opt to secure an EUA.Gamaleya’s decision to apply for emergency approval, should it be granted, would bring its vaccine to a larger number of people as opposed to clinical trials where only a set number of individuals who volunteer to participate will receive it.FDA-issued EUAs are a necessary requirement for any vaccine to be used in the Philippines.

The arrival of COVID-19 vaccines in the Philippines is delayed due to the missing indemnification fund
The House of Representatives passed a bill setting a P500 million indemnification fund to shoulder the medical costs of Filipinos should they experience “adverse effects” after getting vaccinated for the coronavirus.
A total of 225 legislators voted yes to pass House Bill (HB) No. 8648 or the proposed COVID-19 Vaccination Program Act of 2021 on 3rd and final reading on Monday, February 22, 4 days after President Rodrigo Duterte certified the measure as urgent.
No lawmakers voted against the bill, while 6 abstained from the vote.Duterte certifying HB 8648 as urgent allowed lawmakers to do away with the 3-day mandatory interval between its 2nd and 3rd reading approvals.
If passed into law, HB 8648 would create a COVID-19 National Vaccine Indemnity Fund worth P500 million, which would augment the funds of the Philippine Health Insurance Corporation.
A claim for indemnification for serious adverse events must be filed within 5 years from the day of the person's COVID-19 vaccination.
The indemnification fund would be sourced from the 2021 national budget’s Contingent Fund, which are lump-sum appropriations that the government can tapped to finance unforeseen expenses.
The bill states the indemnity would be valid and available for release until it is fully expended or if the President terminates the program.
HB 8648's initial version did not contain a specific amount for the fund. But prior to the measure's 2nd reading approval on Monday, the plenary agreed to substitute HB 8648 with a new version that contains several amendments to include the P500-million indemnification fund and where it would be sourced.
The House plenary tackled other measures on the floor before approving HB 8648 on 3rd and final reading on Monday.
The Philippine government is on a race to create this indemnification fund since it is among the requirements to gain COVID-19 vaccine doses from pharmaceutical companies and the COVAX global facility.Under indemnification programs, governments agree that distributing entities will not be held liable for unexpected adverse events. This is a risk governments absorb during the pandemic when granting emergency use approval for COVID-19 vaccines.Philippine pandemic officials initially announced that COVID-19 vaccines would already arrive by mid-February, but later on said delivery would be delayed due to a lack of an indemnification fund.
The Duterte government was supposedly informed of the indemnification requirement only during the latter phase of vaccine negotiations.MUST READ
Here’s why COVID-19 vaccines haven’t arrived in the Philippines yet
HB 8648 would also grant immunity to public officials and employees, contractors, volunteers, and private sector representatives – including vaccine manufacturers – from claims arising from the vaccine program. But they would not have any immunity if the claims would arise from ""willful misconduct and gross negligence.""
The bill likewise creates a vaccine passport program to serve as a record of the COVID-19 vaccinations received by an individual.
The final version of HB 8648 approved by the House is now closer to the pending Senate version, but some provisions are still either conflicting or are missing from the other chamber's version.
This means both houses would have to convene a bicameral conference committee to thresh out the conflicting provisions before the final version of the bill can be sent to Malacañang for Duterte’s signature.The House or the Senate may also opt to just adopt the version of the other chamber to skip the bicam level.
Fast-tracking vaccine purchase
Apart from creating an indemnification fund, HB 8648 also aims to help expedite the Duterte government’s COVID-19 vaccine procurement by exempting the process from public bidding and granting tax exemptions on the vaccines, supplies, and equipment to be procured.
The bill authorizes the Department of Health and the National Task Force Against COVID-19 (NTF) to engage in ""negotiated procurement under emergency cases"" for the COVID-19 vaccines.
Negotiated procurement would allow the DOH and the NTF to directly negotiate a contract with a capable supplier to speed up the process.
Local government units (LGUs) and private entities would also be allowed to buy COVID-19 vaccines or accept them as donations – but only by signing a multiparty agreement with the national government and the manufacturer concerned. This is the current policy being implemented by the NTF.
LGUs would only be allowed to purchase COVID-19 vaccines for up to 50% of their respective localities' population. But the bill said the Inter-Agency Task Force on Emerging Infectious Diseases may adjust this cap when there are enough supplies available. This power granted to LGUs would be valid retroactively starting from January 1, 2021.
The bill also mandates private companies that would be procuring COVID-19 vaccines to administer them for the ""sole and exclusive use of such companies."" This authority would apply retroactively starting November 1, 2020.
The bill likewise grants tax exemptions on the COVID-19 vaccines to be procured.It would also waive the Phase IV clinical trial requirement for COVID-19 medication and vaccines, but the drugs should still be recommended by the World Health Organization and/or other internationally recognized health agencies.Under the bill's multiparty deal scheme, LGUs and private entities would only be allowed to purchase COVID-19 vaccines that have already been registered with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) or have been issued emergency use authorization (EUA).
So far, only the vaccines created by Pfizer-BioNTech and AstraZeneca have secured EUAs from the FDA.If passed into law, the bill's provisions would be valid during the state of calamity and public health emergency that was declared due to COVID-19 or until June 30, 2022 – unless Duterte lifts the state of emergency or extends it. – Rappler.com","{'AMUSED': 0.24, 'NEUTRAL': 0.16, 'ANNOYED': 0.16, 'ANGRY': 0.16, 'AFRAID': 0.08, 'HAPPY': 0.08, 'INSPIRED': 0.08, 'SAD': 0.0}"

'Any substance that will effectively and safely protect people is considered halal, especially if it is the only viable option at present,' says Saidamen Pangarungan, secretary of the National Commission on Muslim Filipinos
Filipino Muslim leaders on Thursday, February 4, supported the rollout of COVID-19 vaccines and quelled fears that these might contain pork products that they do not consider halal (permissible).
""Any substance that will effectively and safely protect people is considered halal, especially if it is the only viable option at present,"" said Saidamen Pangarungan, secretary of the National Commission on Muslim Filipinos, in a statement signed by 7 other Islamic leaders.
Pangarungan noted, on one hand, that halal certifying bodies or HCBs in the Philippines have not examined these COVID-19 vaccines.
He said Muslim leaders in the United Kingdom, on the other hand, have issued a favorable fatwa or ruling on these. This fatwa, according to him, states: ""The UK government has confirmed that the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine does not contain any components of animal origin.""
Pangarungan said Pfizer also claims ""that all of their vaccine's components are either plant-based or are synthetic."" Like Pfizer, AstraZeneca and Moderna ""have also stated that their vaccines do not use gelatin or pork products.""
In neighboring Indonesia, the world's biggest Muslim-majority country, Muslim leaders recently certified the Chinese vaccine CoronaVac, too, as halal.

""Due to the pressing need to curb the spread of COVID-19, all Filipinos are urged to avail of the vaccine once they become available in the country,"" Pangarungan said, adding that ""Islam emphasizes the need to protect life.""
Whether COVID-19 vaccines are halal has worried many Muslims around the world, as pork-derived gelatin is commonly used in producing vaccines. Muslim beliefs prohibit the consumption of pork.
More than 6 million Muslims live in the Philippines, making up around 6% of this predominantly Christian country.
The Philippine government has sought the help of religious groups to convince Filipinos to take vaccine shots after a recent Pulse Asia survey showed 47% of Filipinos refuse to get vaccinated against COVID-19. Experts have attributed this to widespread disinformation online. – Rappler.com","{'HAPPY': 0.5700000000000001, 'AMUSED': 0.29, 'NEUTRAL': 0.14, 'INSPIRED': 0.0, 'ANNOYED': 0.0, 'SAD': 0.0, 'ANGRY': 0.0, 'AFRAID': 0.0}"

President Rodrigo Duterte says he made the plea with Chinese President Xi Jinping himself 4 days ago
As the coronavirus pandemic continues to spread, President Rodrigo Duterte said he has pleaded with Chinese President Xi Jinping to prioritize the Philippines when providing an effective vaccine that would cure COVID-19.Duterte disclosed this during his 5th State of the Nation Address (SONA) on Monday, July 27, saying he “made a plea” to Xi 4 days ago.“Four days ago I made a plea to President Xi Jinping that if they have the vaccine, can they allow us to be one of the first – or if it's needed that we will have to buy it – that we will be granted credit so we can normalize as fast as possible,” Duterte said in his speech.Coronavirus cases have continued to increase in the Philippines with over 82,000 infected as of Monday. At the start of his speech, Duterte agonized over the “troubled times” the Philippines was experiencing due to the pandemic, pinning his hopes on a vaccine would be “around the corner.”Duterte had earlier spoken with Xi in a 20-minute phone call last June 11 where the Chinese President assured Duterte of China’s assistance in the coronavirus pandemic.
The Philippines is looking to start Phase 3 clinical trials for 5 vaccines in October 2020. Of the 5, 3 are candidate vaccines being developed in China.The global race for a vaccine was recently hit by controversy after the United State Justice Department accused a pair of Chinese hackers of attempting to steal vaccine research and hacking hundreds of companies in the US.The fallout has so far seen Washington order Beijing to close its consulate in Houston, escalating tensions between the two powers.Intelligence agencies in the US, United Kingdom, and Canada also warned hackers believed to be part of Russian intelligence were trying to steal information about a coronavirus vaccine, as reported by the Associated Press.

The law creates a P500-million indemnity fund to be administered by PhilHealth
Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte has signed into a law a bill meant to hasten the procurement of COVID-19 vaccines and create an indemnity fund to be used for individuals who may experience adverse consequences from an anti-coronavirus jab.
Malacañang, on Friday, February 26, confirmed Duterte approved the law, now known as the COVID-19 Vaccination Program Act of 2021 (Republic Act No 11525). Duterte earlier certified the legislation as urgent, speeding up its ratification by Congress.
""We are confident that the signing of this landmark piece of legislation would expedite the procurement and administration of vaccines for the protection against COVID-19,"" said Presidential Spokesperson Harry Roque.
The measure creates a P500-million COVID-19 National Vaccine Indemnity Fund to be administered by the Philippine Health Insurance Corporation (PhilHealth). It will be sourced from the Contingent Fund under the P4.5-trillion 2021 national budget.
The fund will be valid until the President decides there is no need for the it.
The law provides immunity from liability for representatives of private entities, public officials and employees, contractors, and volunteers.
But it does not provide immunity from complaints arising from misconduct and gross negligence, a clause which vaccine czar Carlito Galvez Jr has told Duterte is necessary to protect the government and Filipinos from any malpractice of vaccine manufacturers.
Galvez had said Pfizer required the law as a condition for finalizing the government's orders of its vaccines. Lawmakers had been frustrated that Duterte pandemic officials did not inform them of this early on. Galvez had said they too were supposedly informed late about the requirement.
The issue on indemnification led to a delay in the delivery of Pfizer vaccines, which had initially been projected to be the first vaccines to arrive in the country.
Boon to local governments
The law provides ""legal cover"" for local government units to purchase vaccines and related equipment and resources by themselves.
It exempts such procurements from laws like the Government Procurement Reform Act, the Government Auditing Code of the Philippines, and the Local Government Code.
Mayors had been concerned with procurement rules that appeared to bar government from paying more than 15% of the price of a good when making an advance purchase.
But some lawmakers, like Minority Floor Leader Franklin Drilon, said that current laws allowed payment of more than 15% for emergencies like the pandemic.
For good measure, Duterte had also issued a Memorandum Order allowing local governments to pay more than 15% of advance market commitments, payments required by vaccine manufacturers in order to reserve a supply of vaccines for cities or provinces.
The new law comes two days before the expected arrival of the country's first COVID-19 vaccines – 600,000 doses of the Sinovac vaccine donated by the Chinese government.
The Duterte government is yet to announce any signed supply agreements, the final step to secure doses from manufacturers. – Rappler.com","{'HAPPY': 0.26, 'NEUTRAL': 0.2, 'ANNOYED': 0.14, 'ANGRY': 0.14, 'INSPIRED': 0.0, 'AMUSED': 0.0, 'SAD': 0.0, 'AFRAID': 0.0}"

Carlito Galvez Jr, who is already pandemic national action plan chief implementer, is the 5th 'czar' in the government's COVID-19 response
President Rodrigo Duterte has assigned the role of ""vaccine czar"" to National Action Plan vs COVID-19 chief implementer Carlito Galvez Jr, Malacañang said on Monday, November 2.
Presidential Spokesperson Harry Roque replied in the affirmative to reporters asking to clarify if Duterte's statements in a Super Typhoon Rolly (Goni) situationer meeting meant Galvez had been given the role.
""Pagbili ng bakuna, the negotiation, manufacture, production, or distribution, binigay ko 'yan kay Secretary Galvez,"" Duterte said during the meeting held at the Malacañang Golf Clubhouse.
(For the purchase of a vaccine, negotiation, manufacture, production, or distribution, I've given it to Secretary Galvez.)
""Only Secretary Galvez is authorized to negotiate or whatever. Isa lang. Ayaw ko 'yang committee-committee. Matagal 'yan (Just one person. I don't like committees. They take too long.),"" the President said.
But despite Duterte's disdain for ""committees,"" his own coronavirus task forces are actually composed of a variety of task groups and technical working groups – groups of government officials representing relevant government agencies.
'Task group' on vaccine distribution
Last Thursday, October 29, the Inter-agency Task Force on Emerging Infectious Diseases (IATF-EID) created a structure that would manage and distribute COVID-19 vaccines once they become available to the Philippines.
The vaccine task group is to be led by the Department of Health. It's not clear how Galvez's new role as ""vaccine czar"" affects this arrangement. (READ: What we know about the Philippines’ COVID-19 vaccine plans)
In the same meeting, Duterte expressed his preference for ""only one line of authority come from the task force.""
Galvez already has a leadership role in the government's pandemic efforts, being chief implementer of the national action plan.
His role is distinct from Defense Secretary Delfin Lorenzana, who heads the National Task Force vs COVID-19 (NTF), and Duque who heads the policy-making IATF-EID.
The 57-year-old Galvez served as chief of the military from April to December 2018. After his retirement, Duterte appointed him Presidential Adviser on the Peace Process.
Apart from Galvez, there are 4 other ""czars"" in the Duterte government's COVID-19 response – testing czar Vince Dizon, treatment czar Leopoldo Vega, tracing czar Benjamin Magalong, and isolation czar Mark Villar.
Senate President Pro Tempore Ralph Recto had previously suggested that Duterte appoint a vaccine czar, given the expected challenges of vaccine distribution, including the likely need for a system of ultra-cold storage. – Rappler.com","{'ANGRY': 0.34, 'ANNOYED': 0.16, 'AMUSED': 0.15, 'INSPIRED': 0.0, 'HAPPY': 0.0, 'NEUTRAL': 0.0, 'SAD': 0.0, 'AFRAID': 0.0}"

(1st UPDATE) Father Nicanor Austriaco’s assertion runs contrary to WHO’s position that 'there is no reason not to recommend its use,' even in countries where the South African variant was detected
The Philippines’ 17 million AstraZeneca vaccine doses ""will be ineffective"" – because they would supposedly require an additional shot per person – if the government cannot curb cases of the COVID-19 South African variant in the country, an expert warned on Wednesday, March 3.
In a virtual press briefing, Octa Research fellow and molecular biologist Father Nicanor Austriaco cited studies showing that the efficacy of the ""AstraZeneca vaccine against B1351 dramatically decreased from 70% to 10%.""""With 10% protection, basically, most people would still be able to get mild and moderate COVID-19,"" he said.
The study cited by Austriaco was disclosed by AstraZeneca itself. It had a small sample involving healthy young adults. (READ: AstraZeneca COVID shot less effective against South African variant – study)
The Strategic Advisory Group of Experts (SAGE) of the World Health Organization (WHO) still recommends the use of AstraZeneca, including in countries where the South African variant of the coronavirus may reduce its efficacy. It said the vaccine should be given in two doses with an interval of 8 to 12 weeks, and should also be used in people aged 65 and older.
Even in countries such as South Africa, where questions have been raised about the AstraZeneca vaccine's efficacy against a newly-emerged variant of the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus, ""there is no reason not to recommend its use,"" SAGE chair Alejandro Cravioto had said on February 10.
Since AstraZeneca vaccines come in two doses each, Austriaco said, “We would need three doses of the remaining vaccines because you'd need one booster shot just for the B1351 variant.”While he didn’t disclose it during the press conference, Austriaco is part of a team developing another vaccine. In an interview with CNN Philippines in early February, he said he would be in the United States to conduct experiments on a yeast-based oral vaccine against COVID-19.
